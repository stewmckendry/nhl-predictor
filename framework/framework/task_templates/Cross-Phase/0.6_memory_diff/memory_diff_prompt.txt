ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Detect Missing Files in Memory

You need to ensure that all important project files are tracked properly in memory.yaml.

1. Call the `memory_diff` tool.
2. Review the list of missing files.
3. Propose additions:
   - Draft a basic description for each file
   - Assign the "framework" tag (for now)
4. If the Human Lead approves, add these files to memory.yaml by calling the 'add_to_memory' tool.

Use the following format to pass the new files to the `add_to_memory` tool:

{
  "files": [
    {
      "file_path": "docs/project_goals.md",
      "description": "High-level project goals for the AI app",
      "tags": ["project", "spec", "discovery"]
    },
    {
      "file_path": "outputs/model_evaluation_results.md",
      "description": "Evaluation results from model training",
      "tags": ["project", "outputs", "devpod"]
    }
  ]
}

This ensures that memory.yaml stays synchronized with the GitHub repository over time.
