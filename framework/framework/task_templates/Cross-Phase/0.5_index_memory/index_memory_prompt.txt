ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Index Project Memory

You need to create or update the memory.yaml file by scanning the GitHub repository directly.

1. Use the `index_memory` tool and scan:
   - prompts/
   - scripts/
   - task_templates/
   - main.py
   - openapi.json

2. Save each file path with:
   - A draft description ("To be filled manually or later")
   - The tag: "framework" (for now)

3. After indexing:
   - Review the generated memory.yaml entries with the Human Lead.
   - Refine descriptions or tags if needed.

4. **Use `promote_patch`** to update the memory index (`memory.yaml`) in the GitHub repo.

You are helping to build and maintain the memory scaffolding for AI-native delivery!
