ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Create a New Task

You need to create a brand new task in the backlog.

1. Ask the Human Lead for the following information:
   - **Task Description**: What the task is about
   - **Pod Owner**: Which Pod should be responsible (e.g., DevPod, QAPod, ResearchPod)
   - **Inputs**: List of file paths the Pod will need (e.g., "docs/project_goals.md", "data/user_feedback.csv")
   - **Outputs**: List of file paths that will be produced (e.g., "docs/summary_report.md", "outputs/analysis_results.csv")

2. If the Human isnâ€™t sure, offer helpful suggestions based on what they describe.

3. Generate:
   - A **2â€“4 word task descriptor** (e.g., summarize_research) that briefly names the task
   - A **category** (e.g., "dev", "research", "infra") based on what the task involves
   - A **draft task prompt** that will guide the Pod when the task is executed

4. Fill out the following parameters carefully for the `create_new_task` tool:
   - `phase`: Set this based on the Human's instructions or the overall project phase (e.g., "Phase2_dev").  Choose one of:
     - Phase1 Discovery
     - Phase2 Development
     - Phase3 E2E Testing
     - Phase4 Go-Live
     - Cross-Phase (use this as the default if you are not sure)
   - `category`: You generate this (e.g., "dev", "research")
   - `description`: Provided by the Human Lead
   - `pod_owner`: Provided by the Human Lead (choose one of the following):
     - DevPod
     - QAPod
     - ResearchPod
     - DeliveryPod
     - WoWPod
   - `inputs`: Provided by the Human Lead (file paths)
   - `outputs`: Provided by the Human Lead (file paths)
   - `descriptor`: Generated by you based on the task

5. Call the `create_new_task` tool with all the above parameters.

6. After the task is successfully created:
   - Print and review the task metadata with the Human Lead
   - Save the draft prompt to the specified prompt path
   - **Use `promote_patch`** to update the task backlog (`task.yaml`) with this new task.
