# 📄 AI-Native Feature Tech Spec Instructions

For each feature assigned to a `DevPod`, draft a **technical specification** that clearly communicates what will be built, how it fits the overall architecture, and how it adheres to project standards.

These specs serve both **upfront planning** and **post-delivery traceability**.

---

## ✅ 1. 📋 Spec Metadata
Capture key identifiers and authorship details:

- `spec_id`: Unique identifier for this tech spec  
- `feature_id`: Related feature or epic ID  
- `title`: Descriptive name of the feature  
- `description`: What this feature does and why it matters  
- `author`: Person or pod responsible  
- `status`: Draft, In Review, Approved, Implemented  
- `created_at`: Date created  
- `last_updated_at`: Date last updated  

---

## ✅ 2. 🔧 Functional Overview

- `inputs`: Key inputs (e.g., user actions, API calls, tool outputs, prompts)  
- `outputs`: What the feature produces (e.g., UI response, file, DB entry, LLM output)  
- `user_roles`: Which user roles interact with or are impacted by this feature  
- `use_cases`: List of common usage scenarios or flows  
- `acceptance_criteria`: What conditions define "done"  

---

## ✅ 3. 🧱 Architecture Alignment

- `component_location`: Where this fits in the architecture (e.g., Streamlit UI, FastAPI backend, LLM agent, tool interface)  
- `interfaces`: APIs, tools, memory models, or external services this connects to  
- `data_flow`: Brief diagram or narrative of how data moves through the system  
- `data_model`: JSON/YAML schema or explanation of key data structures  
- `llm_usage`: Where/how LLMs are used (e.g., classification, tool dispatch, generation)  
- `tool_calls`: Any tool actions this feature uses (including OpenAPI, search, validation, etc.)

---

## ✅ 4. 🧑‍🎨 UI & UX Considerations (if applicable)

- `ui_details`: Wireframes, screen IDs, or Figma links  
- `user_flow`: Where the feature appears in the end-to-end journey  
- `accessibility_notes`: Any WCAG or usability considerations  
- `error_states`: How the UI handles edge cases or failures  

---

## ✅ 5. ⚙️ Dev Standards & Non-Functionals

- `testing_plan`: Unit tests, mocks, LLM behavior tests, etc.  
- `logging_plan`: What should be logged and where (inputs, outputs, tool errors, thoughts)  
- `performance_notes`: Any latency, load time, or model cost considerations  
- `security_notes`: Data sensitivity, API protection, access control  
- `compliance_notes`: If this feature impacts auditability, privacy, etc.  

---

## ✅ 6. 🔗 Dependencies & Integration

- `dependencies`: Upstream or downstream features required  
- `feature_flags`: Whether this should be gated or staged  
- `migration_notes`: Any required updates to data, prompts, or tooling  
- `deployment_considerations`: Rollout plan, versioning, or timing  

---

## ✅ 7. 📌 Review Checklist (Before Implementation)

- [ ] Aligned with `solution_overview.md`  
- [ ] Follows `standards.md` (folder structure, logging, testing, prompts, etc.)  
- [ ] Accepted by Product / Tech Lead  
- [ ] Test plan approved  
- [ ] DevPod ready to begin work
