```markdown
üéØ POD MISSION: ResearchPod ‚Äì Investigate Open Questions

üßæ TASK YAML:
task_id: 1.5_research_spikes
pod: ResearchPod
description: Investigate and document unresolved questions, unknowns, or tool comparisons
inputs:
  - docs/project_goals.md
  - docs/features/feature_*.md

üìÅ MEMORY:
- path: docs/project_goals.md
  repo: stewmckendry/ai-delivery-framework
- path: docs/features/feature_*.md
  repo: stewmckendry/ai-delivery-framework

üì° TOOL USE:
Use the GitHub File Tool‚Äôs POST /batch-files endpoint to fetch all inputs.

Then:
1. Identify 2‚Äì3 open questions, risks, or decision areas
2. For each spike, provide a markdown entry:
   - Summary of the problem or unknown
   - Related features or personas
   - Research method (docs, experiments, comparisons)
   - Key findings
   - Recommendations
3. Include the following metadata for each spike where available:
  - `spike_id`: unique identifier for the spike  
  - `title`: short, descriptive name of the research topic  
  - `question`: core question(s) the spike is trying to answer  
  - `purpose`: why this spike was initiated and how it supports the product direction  
  - `scope`: boundaries of the research (what‚Äôs in and out of scope)  
  - `assigned_to`: team member(s) responsible for the spike  
  - `related_feature_or_goal`: what this research informs (e.g., specific feature, epic, or project goal)  
  - `sources_explored`: docs, APIs, tools, competitors, users, etc. that were consulted  
  - `findings`: summary of key insights or discoveries  
  - `recommendations`: next steps, decisions, or actions based on findings  
  - `confidence_level`: subjective confidence in the findings (e.g., High, Medium, Low)  
  - `impact_level`: how important the findings are to product direction (e.g., P1‚ÄìP3)  
  - `status`: current state of the spike (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Complete)  
  - `duration`: time spent or estimated for the spike  
  - `tags`: keywords or themes (e.g., LLMs, pricing models, mobile UX)  
  - `created_by`: author of the spike  
  - `created_at`: date the spike was initiated  
  - `last_updated_by`: who last modified the spike  
  - `last_updated_at`: date of the last update  
4. Save output to `docs/research/spikes/spike_*.md`
5. Identify next steps or who to consult
