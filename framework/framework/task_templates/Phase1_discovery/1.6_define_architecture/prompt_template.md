# 🧠 AI-Native App Documentation Instructions

This guide outlines what to capture in your technical documentation for both the **solution architecture** and **engineering standards**. These materials should serve as living references for all team members and contributors.

---

## ✅ Part A: `solution_overview.md` — Solution Architecture

### 1. 📐 Propose a High-Level Architecture Diagram
- Visualize key components and how they interact
- Include client/server boundaries, AI services, data sources, tools, and external integrations
- Use clear labels and arrows to illustrate data flow and dependencies

### 2. 🧩 Document Major Components
For each component, include:
- `component_id`: Unique name or identifier  
- `name`: Human-readable label  
- `description`: Purpose and functionality  
- `tech_stack`: Languages, frameworks, or services used  
- `interfaces`: Key APIs, events, or contracts it exposes or consumes  
- `inputs`: Data or signals it receives  
- `outputs`: What it produces or modifies  
- `dependencies`: Other components it relies on  
- `owner`: Team or person responsible  
- `status`: (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Stable, Deprecated)

### 3. 🔄 Define System-Level Data Flow
- Describe how data flows across components  
- Call out any asynchronous patterns (e.g., queues, events)  
- Include edge cases (e.g., retries, error handling) if relevant

### 4. 🧠 Highlight AI-Specific Concerns
- `llm_usage`: What LLMs are used for (e.g., classification, reasoning, generation)  
- `memory_model`: How state is persisted (e.g., Git-based memory, vector DB)  
- `prompt_routing`: How prompts are routed to tools, functions, or models  
- `tool_invocation`: When/how tools (e.g., OpenAPI, database, retrieval) are triggered  
- `traceability`: How inputs, thoughts, and outputs are tracked across steps  
- `observability`: Logging and evaluation hooks for reasoning quality  

### 5. 🚧 Raise Architecture Gaps or Risks
- Unresolved decisions  
- Security/privacy concerns  
- Tooling or platform limitations  
- Areas flagged for future iteration

---

## ✅ Part B: `standards.md` — Project Engineering Standards

### 1. 📁 Folder and File Structure
- Define the canonical folder structure for:
  - `src/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `logs/`, `tests/`, etc.
- Include:
  - Purpose of each folder  
  - Placement of feature pods or agents  
  - Where memory, prompts, or evaluation outputs should live

### 2. 📝 File Naming Conventions
- File naming patterns by type:
  - Python: `snake_case.py`
  - Markdown: `kebab-case.md`
  - Prompt templates: `taskname_prompt.md`
- Versioning: e.g., `v1`, `v2`, date-stamped files

### 3. 💬 Prompt Format Standards
- Template structure for prompts:
  - `system`, `context`, `task_instruction`, `format_requirements`
- Naming and reuse of prompt files  
- Prompt modularity (e.g., loading from YAML or markdown)

### 4. 🪵 Logging Conventions
- Required logging for:
  - LLM calls (input, output, model used)  
  - Tool invocations (tool name, inputs, success/failure)  
  - Thought and reasoning chains  
- Log formats: JSON lines, Markdown, or structured text  
- File paths: standard naming and location in `/logs`

### 5. 🧪 Testing and Evaluation
- Unit test framework (e.g., `pytest`)  
- Test types:
  - LLM input/output assertions  
  - Tool response mocks  
  - Thought chain reproducibility  
- Evaluation standards:
  - Reasoning quality metrics  
  - Redundancy, novelty, cost-effectiveness

### 6. 🧠 AI-Specific Standards
- LLM call caching  
- Embedding deduplication  
- Trace tracking and lineage logging  
- Tool cost and call frequency monitoring

### 7. 🎨 UX & Non-Functional Standards

#### ✨ UX Standards
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines  
- Ensure responsiveness across common screen sizes  
- Limit cognitive load (especially for AI-generated content)  
- Provide contextual help and feedback during AI-driven interactions  
- Define consistent UI patterns and component library usage  

#### ⚡️ Performance Standards
- API response time targets (e.g., < 300ms for non-AI calls)  
- Streaming or progressive loading for LLM responses  
- Caching of prompts, embeddings, or tool results where applicable  
- Limit background LLM/tool calls to reduce latency  

#### 🔒 Security & Privacy
- No PII in logs or prompts by default  
- Secure API key and model handling  
- Role-based access control if multiple user types  
- Document AI risk mitigations (e.g., hallucination guardrails)  

#### 📈 Observability & Monitoring
- Define metrics to track:
  - LLM cost per session  
  - Tool failure rate  
  - Evaluation score distributions  
- Set up alerts for spikes in failures or cost  
- Include dashboards for LLM/tool usage patterns

## 📌 Final Steps
- Save outputs to:
  - `docs/solution_overview.md`  
  - `docs/standards.md`
- Tag any open questions or assumptions
- Share with the team for feedback and iteration
