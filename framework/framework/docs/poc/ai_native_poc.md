# üéØ PoD Mission: PoC Field Test ‚Äî Build a Complete AI Micro-App (Inspired by Coaching the Machine + NHL Playoffs)

You are tasked with delivering a complete, working AI-powered micro-application using our AI-Native Delivery System.

The goal: **showcase the power of modular AI-native delivery** ‚Äî fast, traceable, playful, and real.

---

## üßæ Field-Test Workflow

### 1. Understand the Field-Test Goals
- Build something simple, real, and demonstrable.
- Move fast: prioritize modular work and traceability over polish.
- Capture learnings: identify bottlenecks, friction points, improvement ideas.
- Prove how AI-native delivery accelerates real-world app building.

### 2. Select an Initial App Idea ‚Äî Coaching the Machine meets NHL Playoffs!
- Align with the Coaching the Machine philosophy: teaching, guiding, assisting through lightweight, intelligent tools.
- Stay playful and current: theme around the NHL Playoffs!

**Suggested App Ideas:**
- üèí **Playoff Predictor:** Enter game results and predict playoff bracket scenarios.
- üèí **Hockey Game Summary Bot:** Input game recaps; generate summaries in fan, coach, or analyst tone.
- üèí **Coach‚Äôs Quick Scout:** Upload simple stats or notes; generate scouting reports or pre-game plans.
- üèí **Fan Assistant:** Get upcoming schedules, key players, series breakdowns ‚Äî in a fun or serious tone.

‚úÖ **If unsure:** Propose 2‚Äì3 options to the Human Lead for quick selection.

### 3. Spin Up the Project Repository Structure
- Separate framework code from project-specific files.

**Example Structure:**
/framework/         (AI delivery system ‚Äî DO NOT EDIT)
/project1_nhl_poc/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .logs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md


### 4. Initiate Work Using the Delivery Framework
- Create and activate tasks via `task.yaml`.
- Validate inputs (`memory.yaml`, GitHub file fetch).
- Work modularly: small patches, frequent promotions.
- Use `promote_patch` tool after completing each modular deliverable.
- Generate reasoning traces and handoff notes for each patch.

### 5. Use Custom GPT Pods Where Applicable
- Activate ProductPod, ResearchPod, QAPod, DeliveryPod, WriterPod as needed.
- Use standard system prompts and custom actions.

### 6. Track Field Observations
- Create a `field_test_observations.md` file tracking:
  - What worked well
  - Where friction occurred
  - Opportunities to improve the framework, pods, memory, handoffs

### 7. Prepare a Showcase Summary
**Final Outputs:**
- ‚úÖ Working micro-app
- ‚úÖ Full patch + reasoning trace trail
- ‚úÖ Metrics collected (velocity, quality, thoughtfulness)
- ‚úÖ Field test observations and retrospective

## üìé Special Instructions

- Move fast but stay modular (small promotable patches).
- Embed coaching-style thinking: "guide, don't dictate."
- Highlight AI-native benefits ‚Äî and note any weaknesses.
- Capture the spirit of playfulness, learning, and teamwork ‚Äî like a great playoff run!
