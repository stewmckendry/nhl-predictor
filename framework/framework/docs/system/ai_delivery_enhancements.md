# 📓 AI-Native Delivery Framework: Phase 2 Enhancements (April 2025)

## 📊 Purpose

This document captures the next evolution of the AI-Native Delivery System, focused on reducing friction, improving traceability, and accelerating project execution for the NHL Predictor PoC and future AI-native projects.

The goal is to build upon the strong foundations already in place, enhancing the system to be more seamless, automated, repeatable, and auditable.

---

# 🔢 Why Are We Enhancing the Framework?

| Problem | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Too many manual steps | Slows delivery, introduces errors |
| Rigid promote_patch after every micro-task | Overhead, no batching |
| Fragile prompt handling | Blockers when prompts missing |
| Poor chain-of-thought capture | No visibility into how Pods reasoned |
| Manual reasoning traces and handoffs | High human burden |
| Risky memory.yaml drift | Sync issues without structure |


---

# ✨ Future State Vision

| Area | Future Behavior | Outcome |
|:-----|:----------------|:--------|
| Task execution | Activate → auto-update → auto-commit | Fast, fluid task progress |
| Prompt management | Auto-draft prompts, auto-store and commit prompts | No blockers, full traceability |
| Reasoning trace | Auto-generate reasoning aligned with metrics framework | Full auditability, structured reasoning |
| Git commits | Auto-commit major lifecycle updates | Clean history, no micromanagement |
| Promote_patch | Batch promote only meaningful milestones | Strategic, lightweight promotions |
| Chain of Thought | Append reasoning evolution automatically | Human-AI collaboration visible |
| Changelog | Central CHANGELOG.md updated automatically | Clear audit trails |
| Handoff notes | Auto-generate and appendable per task | Seamless Pod transitions |
| Metrics | Integrated reasoning capture, CoT linkage | Improved system learning |
| Project initialization | Repo setup + framework standardization automated | Fast, consistent starting point |


---

# 🔧 Implementation Plan

## 📊 New FastAPI Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `/project/init_project` | Create + initialize new project repo |
| `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` | Append to chain of thought file |
| `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` | Auto-commit minor updates to Git |
| `/tasks/append_handoff_note/{task_id}` | Append or create handoff note |
| `/tasks/append_changelog` | Auto-update CHANGELOG.md entries |


## 📊 OpenAPI Schema Updates

- `/tasks/activate` → Document smart prompt fallback
- Add schemas for new endpoints above
- Confirm promote_patch aligns to new batch promotion logic


## 📊 New Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `scripts/structure_repo.py` | Set up repo scaffolding for projects |
| `scripts/auto_commit.py` | Auto-commit minor updates |
| `scripts/append_chain_of_thought.py` | Append step notes to chain of thought files |
| `scripts/append_handoff_note.py` | Auto-create or update handoff notes |
| `scripts/append_changelog.py` | Add structured entries to CHANGELOG.md |


## 📊 Prompt and Template Updates

| Item | Change |
|:-----|:------|
| DeliveryPod system prompt | Auto-call append_chain_of_thought at key events |
| Project templates | Add `/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/` directories |
| Reasoning trace | Align with structured format for metrics capture |


## 📊 Memory.yaml / Task.yaml Updates

- Link `prompt_used.txt`, `reasoning_trace.md`, `cot.md`, and `handoff.md` to each task if available
- Track `project_init_trace` for project initialization steps


## 📊 Auto-Commit Logic

| Event | Auto-Commit? |
|:------|:------------|
| Task activated | ✅ |
| Task completed | ✅ |
| Prompt drafted due to missing file | ✅ |
| Reasoning trace updated | ✅ |
| Chain of thought appended | ✅ |
| Handoff note updated | ✅ |
| Minor metadata tweak | ❌ (batch later)


## 📊 Chain of Thought Capture

- Chain of thought file `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/cot_{task_id}.md`
- Appended automatically at key reasoning events (activation, updates, pivots)


## 📊 Prompt Management

- Auto-draft missing prompts during `/tasks/activate`
- Auto-save prompts to correct path and commit
- Link prompt to memory.yaml


## 📊 Reasoning Trace Management

- Auto-generate reasoning trace aligned with metrics framework
- Use chain of thought log to enrich reasoning trace
- Save under `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.md`


## 📊 Changelog Management

- Central `CHANGELOG.md` updated automatically
- Every tool that commits changes will also append a structured entry to the changelog.
- Avoid using separate explicit API calls; integrate changelog updates directly into tool handlers for best practice.


## 📊 Handoff Notes

- Auto-generate `.logs/handoff/{task_id}_handoff.md` per task
- Allow appending via GPT or Human Lead
- Linked optionally in memory.yaml


## 📊 Promote_Patch Best Practices

- Human Lead triggers promote_patch after logical milestones (e.g., finish Discovery Phase)
- promote_patch bundles updates, generates changelog, and creates PR


## 📊 Auto-Commit Upgrades to Existing Routes

| Route | Enhancement |
|:------|:------------|
| `/tasks/activate` | After updating task status, save prompt if missing, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/create` | After creating new task, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/update_metadata/{task_id}` | If significant fields updated (done, prompt, etc.), auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/clone` | After cloning, auto-commit updated `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/index` | After reindexing, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/add` | After adding new memory entries, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |

# 🚀 End-to-End Examples

## A) Project Initialization
**Human Lead:**
- Triggers `/project/init_project` with repo details and project metadata.

**GPT Pod Tools:**
- Scaffold repo structure.
- Fetch or create `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml`.
- Capture and save initial prompt and reasoning.
- Auto-commit to GitHub (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`).


## B) Discovery Tasks (1.1 Capture Goals, 1.2 User Flows)
**GPT Pod:**
- Calls `/tasks/activate` for each task.
- Auto-drafts missing prompt if needed.
- Captures prompt_used.txt, reasoning_trace.md, and appends to cot.md.
- Auto-commits "in_progress" and "done" status changes.

**Human Lead:**
- Monitors Pod output.
- Optionally reviews and updates drafts.
- After multiple tasks complete, calls `promote_patch` manually to formalize batch updates.


## C) Development Tasks (2.1 Design, 2.2 Build Feature)
**GPT Pod:**
- Activates each development task via `/tasks/activate`.
- Produces designs, code, documentation.
- Captures full prompt/reasoning trace automatically.
- Auto-commits after meaningful deliverables.

**Human Lead:**
- Reviews outputs as needed.
- Ensures logical batches (e.g., full feature) before triggering `promote_patch`.

# 🔧 Thoughts and Confirmations

✅ This model will:
- Implement foundational enhancements progressively.
- Test practical flows after each major functional upgrade.
- Deliver both the framework AND the NHL PoC app working seamlessly.

✅ Every major SDLC phase will be tested and verified before moving forward.

✅ Risk is minimized by validating at each phase rather than all at once.


# 🚀 Working Approach

Each batch will be implemented using this workflow:
1. Human Lead says "Start next batch."
2. GPT provides overview: changes, outcomes, required inputs/files, assumptions.
3. Human Lead provides inputs/files.
4. GPT generates and prints patches.
5. Human Lead applies patches, tests, and reports back.

This ensures clear communication, clean implementation, and real-world validation.


# 📦 Updated Batch 1: Project Initialization Phase — Kickoff

## 📊 Overview of Changes

We are implementing the project initialization foundation so that:

- A new project repo can be instantly scaffolded.
- Initial project metadata (prompt, reasoning) is captured.
- Git auto-commit happens after initializing core files (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`).
- We set up a clean, repeatable project structure.
- Ensure both `/framework/` and `/project/` directories exist.
- Copy required `/framework/` files into `/project/` to bootstrap the new repo correctly.

## 🎯 Why Are We Doing This?

- Eliminate manual repo setup.
- Ensure every project starts with full traceability and full system capabilities.
- Accelerate project boot-up time.
- Ensure all future Pods are operating from a standardized, ready repo.

## 🌟 Outcomes Expected

- `/project/init_project` FastAPI route fully functional.
- Repo scaffold with `/framework/`, `/project/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/`.
- Framework files copied to project repo as needed.
- Initial `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` created (or verified).
- Initial reasoning trace and prompt captured and committed.
- Repo state is clean, organized, and ready for Discovery tasks.

## 🗂️ Existing Files Needed

To implement Batch 1, I will need from you:

- ✅ `main.py` (current FastAPI server code — you uploaded earlier)
- ✅ `openapi.json` (current schema — uploaded earlier)
- 📂 Template folder structure you want (or confirm "use default"):
  - `/framework/`
  - `/project/outputs/`
  - `/scripts/`
  - `/templates/`
- 📋 Template `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` to use if none exist (or say "draft starter templates")
- 📜 Baseline system prompt text for project initialization (or say "draft starter prompt")

## 📜 Assumptions

- We are working inside a GitHub repo already created externally.
- API has access to PyGitHub authenticated client.
- Repo permissions allow file creation and commits.
- If `/framework/` folder is missing, `/project/init_project` will halt and warn.
- Default framework files will be copied automatically to the `/project/` side for starting point if missing.
- No need for immediate pull request on init — just commit directly to `chatgpt/auto/init_project`.

## 🛎️ Ready for you to:

✅ Confirm or upload:

1. Template folder structure (or "use default")
2. Starter `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` (or "draft starter")
3. Project init system prompt (or "draft starter")

Then, I'll generate the patches! 🚀

When you're ready, just reply with your inputs! 🎯


# 📣 Batch 1 Kickoff — Initialize the Project

## 🏁 Overview

In this batch, we will implement end-to-end project initialization so that:

- We can cleanly initialize a new project repo.
- We copy required framework baseline files into the project folder structure.
- We capture initial project metadata (context, goals, strategy).
- We commit the initialized structure to GitHub under a clean branch (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`).

This is the very first step before we can kick off any SDLC tasks (Discovery, Development, Testing, Go-live).

## 🏗️ Changes to Implement

| Change | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/project/init_project` FastAPI route | To orchestrate project setup |
| Repo renaming (`ai-delivery-framework` → `ai-delivery-framework`) | To accurately reflect that it's the framework |
| Create new repo for NHL Predictor app | Separation of framework vs project |
| Auto-copy `/framework/` files if missing | Ensure project starts with full framework baseline |
| Initialize clean `/project/` folder | Structure organized clearly |
| Create starter `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml` from provided templates | Enable task tracking |
| Draft and store initialization prompt | Capture "Why are we starting this project?" |
| Draft and store initialization reasoning trace | Capture "How was this set up?" |
| Commit changes to GitHub | Full traceability of initial setup |

## 📄 Files You Provided (✅)

- `main.py` (FastAPI backend)
- `openapi.json` (Custom GPT tool schema)
- `task.yaml` (Standard task template)
- `memory_stub.yaml` (Memory starter)

✅ This covers everything needed for the coding!

## ✍️ Starter Prompt for Project Initialization

🧠 **Project Initialization Prompt: NHL Playoff Predictor PoC**

**Context**: We are building an AI-native NHL Playoff Predictor application as a Proof of Concept.  
**Objective**: Capture project goals, flows, architecture, experiments, and delivery traceability using the AI Delivery Framework.  
**Scope**: Start from Discovery (defining goals and user flows), through Development (building features), into E2E Testing and Go-live.  
**Pods Involved**: DevPod, QAPod, DeliveryPod, WoWPod, Human Lead.  
**Deliverable**: A working AI application + proof of enhanced AI-native delivery methods.

## 🔵 Assumptions (✅ Confirmed)

| Assumption | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repo already exists for Framework (`ai-delivery-framework`) | ✅ Yes (will rename) |
| Repo exists or will create new for NHL Predictor | ✅ New repo needed |
| PyGitHub token available and working | ✅ Confirmed |
| Permissions to create files/commit | ✅ Confirmed |
| `/framework/` folder is mandatory for setup | ✅ Yes |
| Default framework files copied if missing | ✅ Yes |
| No pull request needed on init (direct commit) | ✅ Yes |

## 🛠️ Next Steps — Batch 1 Coding Plan

Now that you provided everything:

✅ **Step 1**: I will generate a new `/project/init_project` FastAPI route.  
✅ **Step 2**: It will:
- Check and copy framework files
- Create the `/project/` baseline
- Store `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, initial prompt and reasoning
- Auto-commit to `chatgpt/auto/init_project`
✅ **Step 3**: I'll show you the patches to apply.

## ⚡ Quick Recap: Why Do It This Way?

| Reason | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Eliminate manual repo setup | Faster start for all projects |
| Standardize structure | Fewer mistakes, easier scaling |
| Capture project context from the beginning | Full traceability |
| Automate commit history | Trustable source of truth |
| Clean framework vs project separation | Maintainable for long term |

## ✅ Ready to Start Batch 1?

If yes, I'll proceed to:

- Start generating the `/project/init_project` route
- Print code patches for you
- Hand over for you to apply and test 🎯

# ✍️ Summary of New FastAPI Route

## POST `/project/init_project`

### 📥 Inputs

- `repo_name`: Name of GitHub repo to initialize (string)
- `project_name`: Name for project folder under `/project/` (string)
- `project_description`: Human-readable description (string)

### ⚙️ Actions

- Validate `/framework/` folder exists in the repo.
- Create `/project/{project_name}/` structure:
  - `outputs/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `templates/`
- Copy necessary `/framework/` templates/files into project side.
- Create starter `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml` if missing.
- Capture project initialization prompt and reasoning trace.
- Auto-commit all changes to `chatgpt/auto/init_project` branch.


# 🛠️ 2. Manual Actions Outside Code

To fully implement Batch 1 successfully, you will need to:

| Task | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rename the `ai-concussion-agent` repo → `ai-delivery-framework` | This will officially establish it as the framework repo |
| Create new repo: `nhl-predictor` (or similar) | This will be the PoC project repo |
| Confirm both repos have `/framework/` folder | It must exist and have baseline templates |
| Confirm GitHub PAT has access to new repos | (Should be true if using the same token) |
| After repo rename, adjust any hardcoded repo names if needed | (We'll check together if needed after rename) |

# 📋 3. What’s Left for Full Project Initialization (per Future State Vision)

| Item | Status | Planned Batch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Auto-capture initialization Chain of Thought | ❌ Not done yet | Batch 2 (Discovery Phase Enhancements) |
| Auto-capture `reasoning_trace.md` during project init | ✅ Simple version done (expand later) | Expand in Batch 2 |
| `memory.yaml` linking to project context (`project_init_trace`) | ❌ Not yet | Batch 2 |
| Auto-commit to a structured branch (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`) | ✅ Done |  |
| Create human onboarding prompt/template for new project | ❌ Future optional | Batch 6 (System Polish) |
| Add rollback strategy if init fails mid-way | ❌ Future optional | Batch 6 (System Polish) |

# ✅ Quick Recap

- Batch 1 covers basic project setup and framework copying.
- Minor auto-capture (prompt, reasoning) already done in basic form.
- We'll enrich traceability (Chain of Thought, project context links) in **Batch 2** and polish further in **Batch 6**.


# 🔢 Folder Restructuring Plan for Framework and PoC Projects

## 📂 Framework Repo (`ai-delivery-framework`)

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/framework/` | Core templates, reusable system files (extracted from `task_templates`, `prompts`, `scripts`) |
| `/docs/` | System overview, operations, guides, roadmap |
| `/scripts/` | Shared automation scripts (e.g., `generate_patch`, `init_repo`) |
| `/prompts/` | Templates and archives of used prompts |
| `/task_templates/` | Task blueprints organized by SDLC phase |
| `/` (root files) | `main.py`, `openapi.json`, `requirements.txt`, `task.yaml` (template), `memory.yaml` (stub), `README.md`, `.env`, `.gitignore` |

---

## 📂 PoC Project Repo (`nhl-predictor`)

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/project/data/` | Raw input data, datasets, seed files |
| `/project/notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks for analysis, prototyping |
| `/project/outputs/` | Task outputs (`prompt_used`, `reasoning_traces`, `handoff notes`) |
| `/project/src/client/` | Frontend code (UI) |
| `/project/src/server/` | Backend server code (APIs) |
| `/project/src/utils/` | Shared utilities/helpers |

| `/project/docs/` | Project-specific documentation, API docs |
| `/project/logs/` | System logs, debugging outputs |
| `/project/test/` | Unit tests, integration tests |
| `/framework/` | (Copied from framework baseline at init) |
| `/` (root files) | `README.md`, `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, `.gitignore` |

---

### 🔵 Notes

- `/framework/` in PoC repo will be **static copies** — refreshed manually if needed.
- `/project/` contains **active, growing project-specific work products**.

---

# 🔹 Bash Script for Repo Rename and New Repo Creation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Rename existing repo (manual via GitHub Web UI advised)
echo "Please manually rename 'ai-delivery-framework' to 'ai-delivery-framework' via GitHub settings."
echo "\nWaiting 10 seconds for you to complete..."
sleep 10

# Create new PoC repo
NEW_REPO_NAME="nhl-predictor"
USER="stewmckendry"

# Use GitHub CLI (gh) to create repo
if gh repo view $USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Repo $NEW_REPO_NAME already exists. Skipping creation."
else
  echo "Creating new repo: $NEW_REPO_NAME"
  gh repo create $USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME --public --confirm
fi

# Clone locally if needed
echo "\nTo clone locally:"
echo "git clone https://github.com/$USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME.git"

```

✅ Save as: `scripts/init_repos.sh`
✅ Make executable: `chmod +x scripts/init_repos.sh`

(Note: Assumes you have `gh` (GitHub CLI) installed and authenticated.)


---

# 🚀 Ready to proceed!

Now you can:
- Apply openapi.json patch
- Run repo rename and setup
- Test `/project/init_project`

Then report back for results and next steps!

---

# 📂 Framework Copy Guidelines

## Should It Be in `/framework/`?

| Should It Be in `/framework/`? | Type of File | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ Yes | Templates, reusable task packs, prompt templates, memory stubs, core shared scripts | Reusable assets meant to start any project |
| ✅ Yes | API/Plugin Integration Prompts | Prompts that power tooling (`gpt_tools` prompts) |
| ❌ No | Project-specific data, outputs, logs, test results | Tied to a specific project or PoC |
| ❌ No | POC-specific README, project-specific prompts | Only move generalized docs, not project deliverables |
| ❌ No | `.logs/`, `.gitkeep`, `.DS_Store` | Internal build artifacts or MacOS noise files |
| ❌ No | ChatGPT repo outputs, patch zips | Deliverable outputs specific to PoC sessions |
| ❌ No | Test data, project-specific notebooks/scripts | Stay in project repos like `nhl-predictor/` |

| `/project1_nhl_poc/`, `/test_data/`, `/poc/test_cases/` | ❌ These are project-specific: DO NOT move into framework |
| `/poc/ChatGPT_Git/*.md` test result files | ❌ Stay archived separately if you want (not framework) |
| `.logs/`, `chatgpt_repo/outputs/`, `.DS_Store` | ❌ Ignore — don't copy to framework |

---

# 🚀 In Short:

- ✅ Framework is for **starting any future project fast and clean**.
- ✅ Project-specific deliverables and test data **stay out of the framework repo**.

# 🛎️ Reminder

When you run `/project/init_project`, it copies this `/framework/` into the new project repo under `/framework/` automatically — ready for the Pod to get working.

# 🛠️ Update on Batch 1 Progress

## ✅ What’s Completed

1. Renamed `ai-concussion-agent` repo to `ai-delivery-framework`, synced with local repo, and updated file references.
2. Re-organized files in `ai-delivery-framework` per the new repo structure.
3. Ran `init_repo.sh` to create new `nhl-predictor` GitHub repo.

---

# 🛠️ 1. Setup Local Folder for New NHL Predictor Repo

Now that the `nhl-predictor` repo is created on GitHub, you should:

```bash
# Navigate to your projects folder
cd /Users/liammckendry/Projects/

# Create project standard folders
mkdir -p project/data
mkdir -p project/notebooks
mkdir -p project/outputs/project_init
mkdir -p project/src/client
mkdir -p project/src/server
mkdir -p project/src/utils
mkdir -p project/src/scripts
mkdir -p project/docs
mkdir -p project/logs
mkdir -p project/test

# Also create empty /framework/ folder to be filled later by /project/init_project
mkdir -p framework

# Touch basic placeholder files if necessary
touch project/outputs/.gitkeep

# Clone the new repo
git clone https://github.com/stewmckendry/nhl-predictor.git

# Move into the project folder
cd nhl-predictor
```

✅ You should now have a clean, empty `nhl-predictor/` project folder locally — ready for `/project/init_project`.

---

# 🔥 2. What You Still Need to Do to Complete Batch 1

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Confirm local clone is clean | `git status` inside `nhl-predictor/` should show a clean, empty repo |
| Run `/project/init_project` via your FastAPI app | Inputs:<br>- `repo_name='nhl-predictor'`<br>- `project_name='NHL Predictor'`<br>- `project_description='Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.'` |
| Verify post-init project structure | Check that `/framework/`, `/project/outputs/`, `/project/scripts/`, etc., were properly created |
| Verify auto-commit happened | Check GitHub: repo should have a new commit (`chatgpt/auto/init_project` branch or similar) with init files |
| Confirm reasoning trace + prompt_used.txt | Check `/project/outputs/project_init/` for generated trace files |
| Manual review | - Framework files copied ✔️<br>- Project folders created ✔️<br>- Minor files like `memory.yaml`, `task.yaml` are present ✔️ |

# 📋 Quick Validation Checklist

| Item | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repo cloned locally | ✅ |
| `/framework/` copied into repo | ✅ |
| `/project/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/` created | ✅ |
| `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` exist at project root | ✅ |
| `prompt_used.txt` and `reasoning_trace.md` generated in `outputs/project_init/` | ✅ |

# ⚡ Quick Reminder

✅ **Batch 1** covers:
- Initial project setup
- Framework copy
- Auto-initial commit

❌ **Deferred to later batches**:
- Chain of Thought enrichment
- Project context linking to `memory.yaml`
- Deeper Discovery phase artifacts

# 🛠️ FAQs About `/project/init_project`

---

## 1. Which Repo Does `/project/init_project` Affect?

✅ **Answer**: It creates files/folders inside the `nhl-predictor` repo.

- Even though the FastAPI app (`main.py`) lives in the `ai-delivery-framework` repo, it is programmed to operate on the project repo based on the `repo_name` or `project_path` you pass.
- Think of `ai-delivery-framework` as the **"central brain"** managing multiple projects.

---

## 2. Where Should `main.py` and `openapi.json` Live?

✅ **Answer**: They stay in the `ai-delivery-framework` repo.

- `ai-delivery-framework` is your **core platform**.
- It holds all:
  - FastAPI routes
  - Framework templates
  - System prompts
  - Future tools
- Project repos like `nhl-predictor/` stay **very clean and lightweight** — only project-specific files, **no FastAPI app**, **no OpenAPI spec** inside them.

---

## 3. How Do You Call `/project/init_project`?

✅ **Answer**: You call `/project/init_project` from a **Custom GPT** (like DeliveryPod) or manually.

- **Update your GPT’s** `openapi.json` schema to include the `/project/init_project` route if not already done.
- Alternatively, **manually** call it using:
  - `curl`
  - Postman
  - Swagger UI (e.g., [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) if running FastAPI locally)

---

## 4. Starter Prompt for GPT to Initiate the Project

✅ **Here’s a clean starter prompt:**

### 🚀 Starter Prompt for DeliveryPod

> 🎯 **POD MISSION: Initialize a New Project Repository**  
> We are kicking off a new AI-Native Delivery project.
> 
> **Project Name**: NHL Predictor  
> **Repository Name**: nhl-predictor  
> **Project Description**: Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.
>
> **🛠️ Instructions:**
> - Call the `/project/init_project` endpoint.
> - Pass the fields:
>   - `repo_name = 'nhl-predictor'`
>   - `project_name = 'NHL Predictor'`
>   - `project_description = 'Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.'`
> - After initialization, confirm:
>   - `/framework/` folder has been copied.
>   - `/project/` folders (`outputs`, `scripts`, etc.) exist.
>   - `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` are present.
>   - `prompt_used.txt` and `reasoning_trace.md` are created under `/project/outputs/project_init/`.

🚀 **Goal**: Setup a fully initialized project workspace ready for AI-native delivery.

# 📋 Recap of Confirmations

| Topic | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Which repo gets init? | `nhl-predictor` |
| Where does `main.py` live? | `ai-delivery-framework` |
| Where is `openapi.json` updated? | `ai-delivery-framework` |
| Who calls init? | DeliveryPod GPT or manual API test |
| Is starter prompt ready? | ✅ Yes — see above |

---

# 🚀 Final Prep Before Running `/project/init_project`

- ✅ `openapi.json` updated
- ✅ FastAPI server running (if manual)
- ✅ GPT custom action added (if via GPT)

🎯 **You’re ready to fire `/project/init_project`!**


# 📚 Full Correct Assumptions

| Item | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| A new repo is created per delivery project | ✅ Yes |
| Each repo is initialized at the start using `/project/init_project` | ✅ Yes |
| `/project/init_project` sets up baseline files and structure | ✅ Yes |
| After init, GPT Pods and Human Lead start Phase 1 tasks immediately | ✅ Yes |
| `framework/` folder copied in so each project is semi-standalone but shares standard tooling | ✅ Yes |
| No `/project/NHL Predictor/` needed — all project files live at root level | ✅ Yes |

---

# 🧠 Why This Model is Great

| Benefit | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Clean scaling | 1 repo = 1 project = 1 AI-native lifecycle |
| Easy handoff | Each project repo is self-contained |
| Easy archiving or audits later | Just freeze repo snapshot |
| Easy upgrades | Framework patches can be merged if needed |

✅ It's clean, simple, and scales even as the number of delivery projects grows.

---

# 📋 Therefore Final Answer

✅ **Yes**, you’re supposed to run `/project/init_project` at the start of every delivery project.  
✅ **Yes**, each project lives in its own GitHub repo.  
✅ **Yes**, the outputs (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, `outputs/`, etc.) should be at the **repo root** — no `/project/NHL Predictor/` nesting.
