# ðŸ“š Introduction to LangChain for AI-Native Delivery

---

## ðŸ§  What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source Python library that helps build LLM-powered applications that:

- Reason, plan, and act across tools
- Handle multi-step workflows
- Maintain memory/state across interactions

It provides:

- **Tool Management**: Define external tools LLMs can call
- **Reasoning Agents**: Let LLMs "think" about actions
- **Memory**: Persist information between steps
- **Chains**: Build modular, reusable workflows

---

## âœ¨ Why LangChain Matters for AI-Native Delivery

In our AI-native delivery model, Custom GPTs and Human Leads collaborate on structured tasks.  
LangChain elevates this by allowing:

- Intelligent task planning and chaining
- Human oversight with full control and auditability
- Modular, stateful workflows that scale

## âœ… Key Features Beneficial to Our Model

| Feature                  | Benefit                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tool-based architecture   | GPTs call only approved FastAPI routes                       |
| Zero-shot reasoning agents | GPTs decide when to call actions (e.g., create task, promote patch) |
| Intermediate memory       | GPTs remember prior actions mid-chain                       |
| Modular chaining          | Build flexible SDLC workflows                               |
| Output parsers            | Clean result formatting for logs and metadata               |
| Error handling            | Graceful recovery from tool call failures                   |

## ðŸ›  Example: Wiring LangChain into Custom GPT Actions (via FastAPI)

**Key Principle**:  
Custom GPT âž” Calls a FastAPI Action âž” FastAPI runs LangChain Agent âž” Agent orchestrates tasks.

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Simple Multi-Step Promotion Agent

After Human Lead approves output:

1. Promote patch (`/patches/promote`)
2. Update memory (`/memory/index`)
3. Create next task (`/tasks/create`)
4. Activate next task (`/tasks/activate`)

> **LangChain automatically chains them after human intent.**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Discovery Phase Autopilot

After completing "1.1 Define Goals":

1. Create "1.2 Capture User Flows" task
2. Activate it
3. Prepare briefing for next Pod

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 3: Memory Validation Bot

Periodically:

- Search memory (`/memory/search`)
- Validate files (`/memory/validate-files`)
- Propose patches (`/patches/promote`) if discrepancies found

## ðŸ”© How FastAPI + LangChain Integration Works

| Layer            | Description                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FastAPI Server   | Hosts `/orchestrator/run-workflow` route                          |
| LangChain Agent  | Runs inside FastAPI route, chaining tools                         |
| Tools            | Wrap existing FastAPI endpoints                                  |
| Custom GPT Action | Calls orchestrator, receives high-level result                   |

âœ… **From GPTâ€™s perspective: simple action.  
Underneath: full multi-step orchestration.**

## ðŸ”¥ Example Real SDLC Flows with LangChain Agents

| SDLC Phase     | Example Agent Flow                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

## ðŸš€ How We Can Start

| Step        | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Expose new FastAPI route `/orchestrator/run-workflow` |
| 2           | Wire simple LangChain agent inside                |
| 3           | Define initial tool catalog (task, memory, patch) |
| 4           | Let Human Lead trigger orchestration via command |
| 5           | Expand to richer planning later                  |

## ðŸ“œ Final Notes

- LangChain **extends** (not replaces) Custom GPT + Actions.
- You stay safe, modular, and traceable: everything flows through FastAPI.
- Start simple (e.g., 1â€“2 chained calls) and **grow orchestration complexity over time**.
