# 🧠 AI-Native Delivery System – Mission, Plan & Status Tracker

## 🎯 Mission
To build a fully modular, memory-driven, and patch-based AI-native delivery system where:
- Each **Pod** (DevPod, QAPod, ResearchPod, etc.) is a role-specific Custom GPT
- Work is defined via structured `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, and `prompt_template.md`
- Inputs are retrieved via live GitHub memory (via tool)
- Pods reason and generate outputs automatically
- A human-in-the-loop iterates and approves changes
- All changes are committed via diff-based patching
- Logs, changelogs, and metrics are updated after each task

---

## ✅ Current Progress Summary (April 2025)

### ✅ Full SDLC Delivered Across 4 Phases
We now have:
- Standardized `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, and `prompt_template.md` for **every task**
- Defined steps for all 4 phases:
  1. Discovery
  2. Iterative Development
  3. End-to-End Testing
  4. Cutover & Go Live
- A **PoC Test Pack** and sample stub files for each phase
- Support for file access from **live GitHub repo** using Custom GPT + tool

### ✅ Pod Integration
- DevPod, QAPod, ResearchPod, WoWPod, and DeliveryPod are fully mapped
- Prompts can be generated per task and traced back to original YAML and memory inputs
- Each pod can reason, produce, and log outputs based on GitHub-sourced context

### ✅ Tooling & Execution
- ✅ GitHub File Tool with `GET` and `POST /batch-files` endpoints (via FastAPI + Railway)
- ✅ Tasks retrieve live files from repo using GPT tool actions
- ✅ Outputs are committed via `.patches/` and logs saved to `.logs/`
- ✅ Structured test plans run via PoC packs

## 🛠️ Phase Breakdown (Updated)

### ✅ Phase 0: Core Tooling Foundation *(Completed)*
- [x] GitHub File Proxy (FastAPI + Railway)
- [x] OpenAPI schema + Custom GPT Tool integration
- [x] `GET` and `POST /batch-files` support for memory fetching

### ✅ Phase 1: Standardized Task Framework *(Completed)*
- [x] Defined tasks for every phase and pod in `task_templates/`
- [x] Created `memory.yaml` for every input file
- [x] Included `prompt_template.md` per task for GPTs

### ✅ Phase 2: Prompt Generator *(In Progress)*
- [ ] Script to generate GPT prompt from `task.yaml` + `memory.yaml`
- [ ] Optional human-editable layer before sending to GPT
- [ ] Prompts saved in `prompts/` folder

### ✅ Phase 3: Patch Generation & Application *(In Progress)*
- [ ] `generate_patch.py` and `apply_patch.py` tools scoped
- [ ] `.patches/` files created on successful task completion
- [ ] Integration with GitHub workflows pending

### ✅ Phase 4: Output Logging & Metrics *(In Progress)*
- [ ] Standard structure for `metrics.yaml`, `changelog.md`, and `trace_log.md`
- [ ] Feedback and performance tracked by pod and task

### 🔁 Phase 5: Human Feedback Loop *(Planned)*
- [ ] Review/approve workflow per Pod type
- [ ] Capture inline user feedback, annotate outputs, record lessons

### 🧪 Phase 6: End-to-End Delivery Demo *(In Progress)*
- [ ] Run entire delivery lifecycle using GPT + toolchain
- [ ] Validate: task → pod → patch → PR → merge → metrics

## 🔧 Automation & Hardening Tasks (Planned)

### 🗂️ task.yaml Helpers
- [ ] Generate `task.yaml` for new project
- [ ] Support sprint planning: auto-pull `next tasks` from master `task.yaml`
- [ ] Generate prompts from standard templates + memory.yaml
- [ ] Automatically update task status (e.g., ready → done)

### 🧠 memory.yaml Helpers
- [ ] Auto-update memory.yaml when new files are added/changed in Git
- [ ] Keep memory.yaml in sync with task.yaml
- [ ] Maintain live sync with actual repo contents

### 📦 Patch Generation & Sync
- [ ] Add GPT action to export outputs and generate patch
- [ ] Human script to copy GPT file outputs to local repo
- [ ] Human script to push patch, open PR, notify reviewer
- [ ] Log changes + thought trace + patch metrics

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- ✅ Memory Pod GPT tool runs tasks using live GitHub memory
- ✅ Custom GPT can generate tasks, update files, run tests, and push patches
- ✅ All SDLC stages are modular and testable
- ✅ PoC test packs created for **each of the 4 phases**

---

## ✍️ Notes
- We are now in the polishing phase: patch generator, prompt automation, and metrics capture
- Future milestones include full automation, AI Pod orchestration, and team onboarding

Let’s build the future of software delivery — one task, one pod, one patch at a time 🚀
