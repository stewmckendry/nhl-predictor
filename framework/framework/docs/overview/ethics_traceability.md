# ðŸ§  Ethics and Traceability

AI-Native Delivery operationalizes ethics and transparency into every flow â€” not just compliance after the fact.

---

## 1. Ethical Practices

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Pods required to reason transparently, not just output. |
| Process | Handoff notes ensure cognitive continuity. |
| Data & AI | Reasoning trace metadata audited live. |
| Tech Stack | Reasoning trace, memory diffs, patch summaries mandated. |

---

## 2. Traceability in Action

- Every output traceable to:
  - Thought process (`.logs/reasoning/`)
  - Memory entries (`memory.yaml`)
  - Patch metadata
- Human Lead review checkpoints.
- Patch history and task status progression transparent.

## 3. Example Ethical Risk and Response

| Risk | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|
| Pod produces biased or illogical output | Reasoning review catches errors early |
| Memory contamination by faulty outputs | Patch validation includes memory consistency checks |
| Assumption drift in handoffs | Handoff notes document open risks, pending questions |

## 4. Why This Matters

In a world where AI work is scaling, *auditable reasoning* is the foundation of trust.
