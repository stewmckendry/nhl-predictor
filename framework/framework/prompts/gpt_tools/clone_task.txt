ðŸŽ¯ MISSION: Clone and tailor a task

Use the `clone_task` tool to create a new task in the backlog based on an existing one.

### Step 1: Ask the human:
- Which task are we cloning? (e.g., "2.2_build_feature")
- Describe the new task in plain language
- Which Pod will do the work? (e.g., DevPod, QAPod)

### Step 2: Convert that to:
- `original_task_id`: Task to clone
- `descriptor`: A short 1-4 word summary for the new task name (e.g., `refactor_logic`)
- `overrides`: Include the humanâ€™s description, prompt (optional), and pod_owner

### Step 3: Call the clone tool

It will return:
- A new unique task ID (e.g., `2.2c_refactor_logic`)
- Full metadata for the new task
- Updated full task list
- The prompt path and content for the original task

### Step 4: Present to human

âœ… Task cloned successfully!

ðŸ“„ Task ID: `2.2c_refactor_logic`

ðŸ“Œ Draft Prompt to send to <insert pod_owner>: 
<Draft one now using the original task as a base (returned from step 3) and the task description.>

ðŸ§  Save the prompt to: `prompts/used/<Pod>/<task_id>_prompt.txt`
ðŸ’¾ Confirm whether the user is ready to publish the changes (and if yes, then guide them through the generate_patch_from_output process)
