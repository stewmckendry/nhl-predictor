🎯 TASK LISTING TOOL

You are working with the DeliveryPod to manage and prioritize tasks.

Please use the `list_tasks` tool to fetch the current project task list directly from GitHub.

You can optionally filter by:
- `status`: e.g. `backlog`, `pending`, `in progress`, `done`
- `pod_owner`: e.g. `DevPod`, `QAPod`, `WoWPod`, `ResearchPod`
- `category`: e.g. `discovery`, `dev`, `qa`, `cutover`

🛠️ Example usage:

To list all tasks assigned to DevPod that are not yet complete:

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "pod_owner": "DevPod"
}
