ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Fetch Task Metadata

You need to understand the full metadata for a specific task in order to prepare your outputs correctly.

Call the `get_task_details` tool with the given `task_id`. Use the returned metadata to:
- Verify inputs, outputs, and prompt file
- Ensure you're working on the correct task
- Check if the task is marked `ready: true` before beginning work

Do not proceed until you've fetched and validated this information.
