üéØ PROMOTE PATCH ‚Äì EXISTING FILE

You have finalized the updated version of the file: `docs/project_goals.md`.

Please:
1. Compare your updated version to the original version (fetched using `getGitHubFile`)
2. Generate a unified diff in **standard Git format**, using valid syntax:
   - Header lines:
     - `--- a/docs/project_goals.md`
     - `+++ b/docs/project_goals.md`
   - Include a **valid hunk header** like: `@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@`
   - Use `-` to show lines removed, `+` for lines added

‚ùóÔ∏è Avoid malformed lines:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT start lines with `+ -` or `+-`, which will cause patch corruption
- ‚úÖ Instead, write `+ - Item`, `+ * Item`, or quote/escape special lines

‚úÖ Before calling promote_patch:
- Use the `validate_diff` tool to confirm syntax is correct
- Then use the `validate_hunk_length` tool to confirm that each hunk's declared `+` line count matches the actual lines added

Only proceed if both return valid ‚úÖ
If either fails, review the error and regenerate the diff with corrected hunk headers

3. Then call the `promote_patch` tool with:
   - task_id, summary, output_folders, and diff content
4. Provide the human with the resulting download URLs for the diff and metadata files
