🆕 PROMOTE PATCH – NEW FILE

You have created a new file as part of your task output: `docs/return_to_play.md`.

Please:
1. Format a unified diff that represents adding this new file
2. Use the correct Git-style diff structure:
   - Header lines:
     - `--- /dev/null`
     - `+++ b/docs/return_to_play.md`
   - Use a valid hunk header with line numbers (even for new files):
     - Example: `@@ -0,0 +1,5 @@`
   - Include each new line prefixed with `+`
   - Avoid using lines that begin with + - directly after the +. Either add a space, quote the line, or rewrite the list format.
   - Ensure that the diff is clear and easy to read, maintaining proper formatting.

❗️ Avoid malformed lines:
- ⚠️ Do NOT start lines with `+ -` or `+-`, which will cause patch corruption
- ✅ Instead, write `+ - Item`, `+ * Item`, or quote/escape special lines

✅ Before calling promote_patch:
- Use the `validate_diff` tool to confirm syntax is correct
- Then use the `validate_hunk_length` tool to confirm that each hunk's declared `+` line count matches the actual lines added

Only proceed if both return valid ✅
If either fails, review the error and regenerate the diff with corrected hunk headers

3. Then call the `promote_patch` tool with:
   - task_id, summary, output_folders, and diff content
4. Provide the human with the resulting download URLs for the diff and metadata files
