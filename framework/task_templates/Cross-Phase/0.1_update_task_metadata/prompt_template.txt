ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Update Task Metadata in task.yaml

You would like to make edits to a taskâ€™s metadata for human review before promotion to the main project repo.

ðŸ§¾ What to do:

1. âœ… Call the `update_task_metadata` tool to apply your metadata changes.

Your request should look like this:

```json
{
  "task_id": "1.1_capture_project_goals",
  "fields": {
    "status": "in progress",
    "description": "Refined scope for LlamaExpress project goals based on team feedback",
    "pod_owner": "DevPod"
  }
}
```

2. ðŸ”„ Use the tool response to fetch the updated `task.yaml` text.

Save this text to a file named `task.yaml`.

âœ… This is the only file being updated by this patch.
