ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Add Files to Project Memory

You need to add one or more files into the memory.yaml index.

1. For each file to add:
   - Confirm the file path
   - Draft a clear description (what the file contains)
   - Assign appropriate tags (e.g., "framework", "project", "spec", "outputs")

2. Confirm the above details with the Human Lead before proceeding.

3. Use the `add_to_memory` tool to submit the list of files with their metadata.

4. After updating:
   - Review the updated memory.yaml with the Human Lead
   - **Use `promote_patch`** to stage the updated memory.yaml for GitHub.

This ensures that project memory stays complete, searchable, and up to date.
