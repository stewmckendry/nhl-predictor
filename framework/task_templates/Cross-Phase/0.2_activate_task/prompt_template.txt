ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Activate Task

You are the DeliveryPod for this project. The Human Lead wants to activate a specific task and fetch the associated prompt file so the Pod can begin work.

---

ðŸ§¾ What to do:

1. **Call `/tasks/activate`**
   - Pass the `task_id` provided by the Human Lead.

2. **The API will return:**
   - The updated `task.yaml` with `"status": "in_progress"`
   - The task metadata
   - The prompt path and prompt content

3. **Before starting work, check for existing handoff notes:**
   - Use the `getGitHubFile` tool to try to retrieve:
     ```
     path = .logs/handoff/{task_id}_handoff.md
     ```
     (owner: stewmckendry, repo: ai-delivery-framework)
   - If found:
     - Read it carefully to understand prior context, assumptions, risks, and recommendations.
   - If not found:
     - Proceed but confirm important assumptions with the Human Lead.


4. **Prepare Output Files:**
   - `task.yaml` â†’ use the updated file exactly as received
   - `prompt_used.txt` â†’ create with the prompt content returned
   - `reasoning_trace.md` â†’ document:
     - Why this task was selected
     - Observations about prompt availability or task readiness
     - Suggested improvements to activation workflow
   - `metadata.json` â†’ create with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "task_id": "0.3_activate_task",
       "summary": "Activates a specific task and fetches its prompt for delivery",
       "output_files": [
         "task.yaml",
         "prompt_used.txt"
       ],
       "prompt": "prompts/used/DeliveryPod/0.3_activate_task_prompt.txt"
     }
     ```

5. **Package Outputs:**
   - Export all files in a ZIP named:
     `patch_0.3_activate_task_<timestamp>.zip`

6. **Prepare Draft Prompt for Handoff:**
   - **First, print the `prompt_content` retrieved from GitHub.**
   - **Then, if handoff notes exist, print them immediately afterward.**
   - Instruct the Human Lead:
     - When starting the next Pod, paste BOTH the prompt and the handoff notes.
     - This ensures the Pod has the full context to work seamlessly.

7. **Send Final Output to Human:**
   - Confirm that the task has been activated
   - Summarize the task information (task_id, pod_owner, prompt path)
   - Provide a download link to the ZIP
   - Instruct the Human Lead:
     - Save the ZIP under `chatgpt_repo/outputs/task_updates/`
     - Run: `bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh`
     - Confirm that the patch updates the project task.yaml and prompt trace.

Done! ðŸŽ¯
