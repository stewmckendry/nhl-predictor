ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Validate File Existence in Project Memory

You need to check if specific file paths exist in the project's memory system.

1. Use the `validate_memory_file_exists` tool.
2. Provide the list of file paths to check.
3. Review the returned results:
   - Confirm if files exist in memory.yaml
   - Confirm if files exist in the GitHub repo
4. Report any missing files to the Human Lead for action.

This ensures Pods work with complete, reliable project context.
