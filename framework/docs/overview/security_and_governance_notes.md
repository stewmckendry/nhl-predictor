# ðŸ”’ Security and Governance Notes

Security and governance are embedded into the AI-Native Framework at the system architecture level â€” not added after.

## 1. Secure Access Management

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Custom GPTs authenticate with secure tokens only. |
| Process | GitHub repo access managed by minimal permissions. |
| Data & AI | No memory or task corruption allowed without patch review. |
| Tech Stack | FastAPI auth layers + GitHub token scoping. |

## 2. Governance at Work

- Every promoted output must include:
  - Reasoning trace
  - Memory delta
  - Patch metadata
- Memory diffs validated before merge.
- Optional ethical retros per project milestone.

## 3. Philosophy

Governance should **amplify creativity** and **protect integrity** â€” not stifle velocity.

Well-designed security becomes *invisible* to teams, but *visible* to audits.
