# ðŸš€ AI-Native Delivery Roadmap (2025-04-23)

Each level builds on the last â€” from patch execution to AI-enabled planning, memory, and team scaling.

---

## ðŸ¥‡ Level 1: Close the Loop â€“ Patch Delivery & Promotion

Ensure every Pod output becomes a valid, reviewable Git patch.

| Enhancement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
âœ… `promote_patch.sh` auto-opens PR | Human-free patch-to-PR flow  
âœ… Validate `diff` format in GPT | Prevent malformed patches  
âœ… Return `download_url` for all diffs | Safe, consistent file handling  
âœ… Add `.patch.yaml` per patch | Enables tracking, metrics, and traceability  
âœ… Append `.trace_log.md` | Chronological activity log for all tasks  
âœ… Enable PR comment from task metadata | Improves review and context  

---

## ðŸ¥ˆ Level 2: Task + Memory Management (Agile AI-Native Workflows)

Introduce AI-powered planning, task flow, and memory coordination.

| Enhancement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
âœ… `task.yaml` with status & prompt linkage | Enables Pod-based task routing  
âœ… GPTs update `task.yaml.status` | Tracks flow from `ready` â†’ `in_progress` â†’ `done`  
âœ… `memory.yaml` auto-refreshed from GPT output | Keeps AI memory consistent with Git  
âœ… `MemorySync` tool (auto-updates summary/tags) | AI remembers what it just changed  
âœ… GPT logs file updates to `.trace_log.md` | Full change trace across tasks  
âœ… `Smart Task Router` tool | GPT can pick next ready task with context preloaded  

---

## ðŸ¥‰ Level 3: Planning, Metrics, and Prompt Intelligence

Coordinate delivery and analyze system effectiveness.

| Enhancement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
âœ… Patch lineage â†’ `task.yaml` + `patch.yaml` | Links output to origin  
âœ… Update `metrics.yaml` per patch/task | Enables velocity & quality tracking  
âœ… Structured PR review template (`patch_review.md`) | Improves feedback, QA, and approval  
âœ… Group patches by feature (`promote_batch.sh`) | Enables atomic, multi-file updates  
âœ… Reviewer assignment via patch metadata | Closes loop from Pod to human  

---

## ðŸ§ª Level 4: AI-Native Developer Experience (PodOps)

Build tooling and UX around Pod flows and Git-native thinking.

| Enhancement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
âœ… Streamlit UI for patch preview | Visual diffs before PR  
âœ… GPT test runners | Validate patches, score outputs  
âœ… Prompt registry with metadata | Organized, reusable, inspectable Pod knowledge  
âœ… Patch replay/test simulator | Run diffs safely before commit  
âœ… Slack or email notifications | Patch â†’ PR â†’ Approver â†’ Done loop  

---

## ðŸ§© Feature Naming

| Theme | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Task & memory management | `TaskFlow`, `PodSprint`, `MemorySync` |
| Patch metadata & traceability | `PatchMap`, `trace_log.md`, `.patch.yaml` |
| Prompt & tool orchestration | `PromptHub`, `ToolPack`, `PodTools` |


# Backlog of future ideas

1. ðŸ’¡ Bonus Thought (for future automation)
Eventually, we might create a validate_patch_metadata tool that GPT could call before packaging. This could:

Confirm all files exist (prompt, outputs)
Check metadata completeness (task_id, prompt path, etc.)
Validate filenames match output_files
Would be handy for GPT to "lint" the patch before handing off!
