[]: # ### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
[]: # 
[]: # - **No GPT user-specific auth**: Require `repo_name` and `repo_owner`, validate fork in backend
[]: # - **Risk of shared repo overwrites**: Force writes to forked repo or sandbox branches
[]: # - **Risky tool exposure**: Expose only safe, read/write-limited tools
[]: # - **New user onboarding**: Provide clear guide via GPT system message and markdown link
