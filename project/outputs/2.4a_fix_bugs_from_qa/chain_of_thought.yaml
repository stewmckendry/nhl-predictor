- message: '- Identified that the core problem was missing a Next.js Node project
    definition (no package.json, no index page).

    - Focused first on minimal fixes to unblock Railway deployment (basic package.json
    and index.js page).

    - Logged fixes clearly in a structured bug report so future QA or developers can
    trace the deployment fixes easily.'
