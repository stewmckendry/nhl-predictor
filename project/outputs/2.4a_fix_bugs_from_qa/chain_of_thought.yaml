- message: '- Identified that the core problem was missing a Next.js Node project
    definition (no package.json, no index page).

    - Focused first on minimal fixes to unblock Railway deployment (basic package.json
    and index.js page).

    - Logged fixes clearly in a structured bug report so future QA or developers can
    trace the deployment fixes easily.'

- message: '- Logged all deployment errors and applied fixes manually due to rapid
    iteration and volume.

    - Captured each issue and resolution in a structured markdown bug report.

    - For future, recommend pre-deploy validation with Railway CLI and stricter environment
    checks.

    - Also suggest automated checks for common folder misplacement and port mismatches.'

- message: '- Frontend lacked clarity and polish; raw JSON output was confusing.

    - Used usability heuristics (NNGroup) to drive redesign.

    - Added title, instructions, clearer labels, and a visual bracket display.

    - Fixes elevate user experience and help align product design with user expectations.

    - Future projects should include heuristic-driven design checklists earlier in
    UX planning.'

- message: '- Focused UX upgrades made the app dramatically easier and more delightful
    to use.

    - MVP changes prioritized guided flow (instructions, inputs), validation (max
    4 wins), and payoff (celebration for winner).

    - Additional polish like loading states and hiding the form after simulation improves
    clarity and flow.

    - Future: Include a UX heuristic checklist in spec phase to build in quality earlier.'
