- message: '- Identified that the core problem was missing a Next.js Node project
    definition (no package.json, no index page).

    - Focused first on minimal fixes to unblock Railway deployment (basic package.json
    and index.js page).

    - Logged fixes clearly in a structured bug report so future QA or developers can
    trace the deployment fixes easily.'

- message: '- Logged all deployment errors and applied fixes manually due to rapid
    iteration and volume.

    - Captured each issue and resolution in a structured markdown bug report.

    - For future, recommend pre-deploy validation with Railway CLI and stricter environment
    checks.

    - Also suggest automated checks for common folder misplacement and port mismatches.'
