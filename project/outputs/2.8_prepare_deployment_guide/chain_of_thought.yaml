    to match hosting decisions.

    - Deliberately kept environment setup lightweight (no DBs, no auth) to keep MVP
    flow frictionless.

    - Structured the guide modularly to allow fast upgrades to production or external
    APIs if needed later.'

- message: '- Added optional deployment instructions via Railway''s website for teams
    who prefer GUI workflows over CLI.

    - Emphasized keeping deployment accessible to both technical and semi-technical
    users.

    - Future-proofed by suggesting GitHub Repo linkage, allowing smoother CI/CD setup
    later if desired.'
