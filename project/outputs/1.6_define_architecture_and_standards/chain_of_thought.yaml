    to maximize speed and clarity for the MVP.

    - Focused standards on file structure, lightweight logging, and basic test coverage
    without overengineering.

    - Deliberately excluded advanced AI-specific practices since MVP doesn''t depend
    on LLMs yet.'

- message: '- Updated architecture to explicitly host API layer on Railway Cloud,
    matching ai-delivery-framework''s hosting.

    - Clarified Railway serverless deployment in both architecture diagram and standards
    folder structure.

    - This keeps hosting simple, consistent, and allows leveraging known workflows
    like environment configs and serverless scaling.'

- message: '- Added a static "Bracket Definition File" (YAML or JSON) to explicitly
    define initial matchups and bracket rules.

    - Updated the architecture and data flow to show the simulator engine consuming
    this bracket config.

    - This approach ensures flexibility for future seasons and simplifies simulation
    logic for MVP.'
