- message: '- Created a basic `simulate_playoffs` engine that supports round-by-round
    simulation using static inputs.

    - Built and validated unit test that checks output structure and prediction logic.

    - Kept everything minimal and deterministic-compatible (with randomness as fallback),
    ensuring it''s extendable later.'

- message: '- Carefully modularized the build: engine, bracket definition, API handler,
    and frontend were all cleanly separated for easier future updates.

    - Prioritized simple text/json inputs for MVP to eliminate the need for custom
    bracket UI in the first version.

    - Designed the API and Frontend to assume happy paths first (fully valid inputs),
    optimizing for faster user feedback loops while leaving clear space for error
    handling upgrades.'
