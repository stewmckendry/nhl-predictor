- message: '- Created a basic `simulate_playoffs` engine that supports round-by-round

    - Built and validated unit test that checks output structure and prediction logic.

    - Kept everything minimal and deterministic-compatible (with randomness as fallback),
    ensuring it''s extendable later.'
