- message: '- Created a basic `simulate_playoffs` engine that supports round-by-round
    simulation using static inputs.

    - Built and validated unit test that checks output structure and prediction logic.

    - Kept everything minimal and deterministic-compatible (with randomness as fallback),
    ensuring it''s extendable later.'
  timestamp: '2025-04-29T18:49:42.447848'
- message: '- Carefully modularized the build: engine, bracket definition, API handler,
    and frontend were all cleanly separated for easier future updates.

    - Prioritized simple text/json inputs for MVP to eliminate the need for custom
    bracket UI in the first version.

    - Designed the API and Frontend to assume happy paths first (fully valid inputs),
    optimizing for faster user feedback loops while leaving clear space for error
    handling upgrades.'

- message: '- Refactored simulate_playoffs to support all 4 playoff rounds using source-based
    team resolution.

    - Preserved the round-by-round format for readability and debugging ease.

    - Test validated end-to-end simulation flow from round_1 through Stanley Cup champion
    using minimal mock bracket.'

- message: '- Added FastAPI server and updated Node.js proxy with env-based backend
    URL.

    - Updated requirements.txt and package.json for new dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn,
    dotenv).

    - Extended deployment guide to clearly split frontend and backend deployment paths
    on Railway.

    - Focused on flexibility to support local dev and cloud deployment without hardcoding
    anything.'

- message: '- Caught that a placeholder message was incorrectly committed for deployment
    guide.

    - Regenerated full deployment instructions and re-submitted using complete_task.

    - Will double-check preview content before future submit calls to avoid missing
    outputs.'
  timestamp: '2025-04-29T22:04:27.137016'
- message: '- Captured final live frontend and backend URLs in the deployment guide
    for easy reference.

    - This avoids friction for QA, demos, and future developers.

    - In future, consider creating a dedicated runbook or .env summary file to centralize
    deploy-specific config.'
