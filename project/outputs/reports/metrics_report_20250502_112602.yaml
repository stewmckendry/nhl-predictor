reasoning_summary: The main reasoning themes across multiple AI tasks include completing
  tasks based on project goals, considering additional goals from stakeholders, and
  involving user interviews earlier in the process. Key insights discovered include
  the importance of validating basic lifecycle transitions and the need to add edge
  case tests for reopening and scaling. Common patterns of memory reuse (recall) involve
  repeating the process of completing tasks based on project goals and involving user
  interviews. Novel ideas that emerged include considering additional goals from stakeholders
  and the importance of edge case testing. Overall, the AI reasoning shows a strong
  focus on project goals and stakeholder involvement, with room for improvement in
  considering edge cases and user feedback.
