- message: '- Added a lightweight `predict_series_winner` function using random choice
    for MVP simplicity.

    - Acknowledged future potential enhancements (seeding, historical data) to keep
    roadmap extensible.

    - Focused on unblocking development immediately without overcomplicating the early
    simulation logic.'

- message: '- Clarified the engine logic by documenting simulate_playoffs and predict_series_winner
    clearly in the spec.

    - Emphasized deterministic logic fallback to randomness to match MVP speed-first
    design.

    - Listed potential enhancements to set clear roadmap paths for smarter simulation
    later.'

- message: '- Clarified that the current simulate_playoffs implementation only simulates
    round_1 explicitly using direct team names.

    - Added explicit note that full multi-round simulation (using ''source'' references)
    is not yet implemented.

    - Provided roadmap pointer to extend simulate_playoffs for round_2 and beyond
    as a core enhancement opportunity.'
