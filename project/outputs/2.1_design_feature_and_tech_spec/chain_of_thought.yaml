- message: '- Clarified the engine logic by documenting simulate_playoffs and predict_series_winner
    clearly in the spec.

    - Emphasized deterministic logic fallback to randomness to match MVP speed-first
    design.

    - Listed potential enhancements to set clear roadmap paths for smarter simulation
    later.'
