- message: '- Added a lightweight `predict_series_winner` function using random choice
    for MVP simplicity.

    - Acknowledged future potential enhancements (seeding, historical data) to keep
    roadmap extensible.

    - Focused on unblocking development immediately without overcomplicating the early
    simulation logic.'

- message: '- Clarified the engine logic by documenting simulate_playoffs and predict_series_winner
    clearly in the spec.

    - Emphasized deterministic logic fallback to randomness to match MVP speed-first
    design.

    - Listed potential enhancements to set clear roadmap paths for smarter simulation
    later.'
  timestamp: '2025-04-29T20:54:19.420723'
- message: '- Clarified that the current simulate_playoffs implementation only simulates
    round_1 explicitly using direct team names.

    - Added explicit note that full multi-round simulation (using ''source'' references)
    is not yet implemented.

    - Provided roadmap pointer to extend simulate_playoffs for round_2 and beyond
    as a core enhancement opportunity.'
  timestamp: '2025-04-29T20:59:54.946142'
- message: '- Designed a clean extension of simulate_playoffs() to support multi-round
    playoff simulations.

    - Introduced a round-by-round loop structure and dynamic winner resolution using
    ''source'' keys.

    - Maintained backward compatibility for round_1 while unlocking bracket-wide predictive
    capability for the MVP.'

- message: '- Realized that Python simulation logic could not run natively inside
    Node.js Next.js APIs.

    - Decided to introduce a lightweight FastAPI server to expose Python engine over
    HTTP.

    - Designed a clean architecture: Next.js client -> Serverless API proxy -> FastAPI
    Python server -> simulation_engine.

    - Future-proofed by keeping the API contract simple and easy to extend later.'
  timestamp: '2025-04-29T21:31:01.760936'
- message: '- Expanded the spec with richer detail on frontend, API, and backend components.

    - Mapped sequence flow clearly to reduce cognitive load for readers and new contributors.

    - Designed the spec not only for accuracy but also for learning and onboarding
    future developers.'
