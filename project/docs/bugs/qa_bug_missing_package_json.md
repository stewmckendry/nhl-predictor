# ðŸ”§ Bug Report: Missing Node.js Project Structure

## Bug Summary
- **Problem:** Railway deployment failed due to missing `package.json` and `start` script.
- **Root Cause:** Original project structure lacked a defined Node.js app setup. The frontend was scaffolded assuming React/Next.js, but no Node project files existed.

## Bug Details
- Railway Nixpacks could not detect a build plan.
- After setting Deploy Directory to `/project/`, it still failed without a `start` script.

## Fix Summary
- Created `project/package.json` with standard `dev`, `build`, and `start` scripts.
- Created `project/pages/index.js` to properly route the Next.js homepage.

## Impact
- Project is now Railway Cloud deployable.
- Frontend and API layers properly recognized by Node/Next.js framework.

## Files Added/Updated
- `project/package.json`
- `project/pages/index.js`

## Follow-up
- Future CI/CD pipelines should validate presence of core project files (like `package.json`) before attempting deploys.
