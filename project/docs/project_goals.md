## üèÖ Goals

### Goal 1: Build a Playoff Simulation App
- **Goal ID:** goal_001
- **Title:** Core Playoff Predictor App
- **Description:** Enable users to input series scores and simulate playoff bracket paths and outcomes.
- **Why It Matters:** Makes NHL playoffs more engaging, educational, and predictive for users.
- **Success Criteria:** Users can input results and receive a predicted Finals matchup and champion in under 10 seconds.
- **Priority:** High
- **Timeframe:** MVP by initial demo date
- **Alignment:** AI-native Delivery Framework (Modular Development, Real-Time Feedback)

### Goal 2: Prioritize Speed and Iteration Over Complexity
- **Goal ID:** goal_002
- **Title:** Rapid Development Focus
- **Description:** Keep features lightweight and iterative, avoiding unnecessary complexity to allow quick demonstrations and feedback.
- **Why It Matters:** Demonstrates the "Coaching the Machine" philosophy, proving the value of small, teachable increments.
- **Success Criteria:** Deliver multiple working iterations within short timeframes (~2‚Äì3 days).
- **Priority:** High
- **Timeframe:** Ongoing through initial release
- **Alignment:** AI-native Delivery Framework

### Goal 3: Modular, AI-Native System Architecture
- **Goal ID:** goal_003
- **Title:** Modular and Extendable Architecture
- **Description:** Structure the app so individual components (e.g., score input, bracket visualization, prediction engine) are swappable and independently improvable.
- **Why It Matters:** Supports future experimentation and adaptation without major rework.
- **Success Criteria:** Core modules are clearly separated with simple, documented interfaces.
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Timeframe:** Post-MVP optimization
- **Alignment:** Modular Delivery Principle

## üîç Gaps & Assumptions
- **Gaps:**
  - No explicit user persona details yet (e.g., hardcore fan vs casual user)
  - No exact timeframe for "initial demo date"

- **Assumptions:**
  - Users will value speed and fun over perfect prediction accuracy.
  - MVP will prioritize North American (NHL) playoff structure.
