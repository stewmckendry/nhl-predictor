# 🌱 Welcome to the AI Delivery System (Non-Technical Guide)

This guide will help you understand how our system works and how you can participate — even if you don’t have a technical background.

## 🤖 What Is This System?

This is a new way to deliver projects where **AI acts like a team member**. It can:

- Plan and complete tasks
- Write documents and code
- Track its reasoning and progress
- Communicate with humans for review and help

As the Human Lead, your job is to guide the AI like a teammate — not write code yourself.

## 👥 Meet the AI Pods

Each Pod is like a role on a real team — but powered by AI. Here’s what each one does:

| Pod | What They Do |
|-----|---------------|
| **ProductPod** | Figures out what to build and how to build it |
| **QAPod** | Checks the AI’s work and makes sure it’s correct |
| **ResearchPod** | Finds useful information to guide better solutions |
| **WoWPod** | Improves how the team works — process, habits, feedback |
| **DeliveryPod** | Keeps tasks moving and tracks overall progress |
| **WriterPod** | Writes documents, announcements, and release notes |
| **PromptPod** | Helps the other Pods talk to GPT better by writing smarter prompts |

These Pods work together like a real team — each with its specialty.

## 🧱 What Types of Tasks Do We Have?

The system is built to support app delivery from idea to launch. Here are examples of tasks it can handle:

### 🌱 Phase 1: Discovery
- Capture project goals
- Define users and delivery flows
- Break features into smaller pieces
- Write acceptance criteria
- Run research spikes
- Set architecture and standards

### 🔁 Phase 2: Build & Iterate
- Design features and specs
- Build and patch work
- QA and fix bugs
- Add research or support steps
- Track agile metrics
- Prep for deployment

### ✅ Phase 3: Testing
- Plan and run end-to-end testing
- Fix any issues
- Run demos and finalize reports

### 🚀 Phase 4: Go Live
- Plan cutover
- Do final checks and launch
- Announce go-live
- Hold a team retro

These tasks are all tracked in the system and can be updated or customized over time.

## 🛠️ What Can You Do?

You can guide the AI using simple tools. Here are the most common things you might do:

| Action | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| ✅ **Start a task** | Tells the AI to begin work on the next item |
| 🧠 **Add a thought** | Log your own ideas or help the AI clarify its thinking |
| 🏁 **Complete a task** | Mark a task finished and submit its outputs |
| 🔁 **Reopen a task** | Go back and improve something if needed |
| 📂 **Upload or log a file** | Add a file to the project or memory so the AI can use it |
| 🔎 **Search memory** | Ask the AI to look for relevant files, past work, or plans |
| 📈 **View metrics** | See how the project is doing overall (task count, progress, etc.) |
| 🧾 **List all tools** | Ask what actions are available right now |
| 📘 **Get this guide again** | Use the “onboarding guide” tool to remind yourself how the system works |
| ↩️ **Rollback a change** | Undo a previous file or task change if something went wrong |
| 🧠 **Summarize recent thoughts** | Ask for a summary of the AI’s reasoning across tasks |
| 🗂 **Clone or create a task** | Add new work or reuse a similar task as a starting point |

You don’t need to know the command names — just ask GPT what to do and it will use the right tool.

---

## 📊 Where to Find Reports

| Report | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| `changelog.yaml` | Everything the AI has changed |
| `reasoning_trace.yaml` | The AI’s thinking for each task |
| `metrics_report.yaml` | Project-level stats like speed and quality |
| `reverted_commits.yaml` | Fixes and undo history |

---

## 💡 Tips

- You can ask the AI to explain its reasoning.
- If you’re unsure what to do, ask: “What’s the next task?” or “Where do you need help?”
- Everything is logged — nothing is lost.

## ✅ You’re In!

You’re now part of a modern, AI-supported delivery process. Your job is to guide the AI with goals, feedback, and decisions. The system handles the details.

Let’s build something amazing — together.
