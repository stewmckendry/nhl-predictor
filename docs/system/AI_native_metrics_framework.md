# 📄 AI-Native Metrics Framework (v1) — Full System Design

---

## 1. 🎯 Mission and Principles

### Mission

> Enable Human Leads to observe, understand, and continuously improve delivery performance and reasoning quality in an AI-native system.

### Principles

- 📊 Track both **quantitative delivery signals** and **qualitative reasoning signals**.
- 🔎 Prioritize **insightfulness** over raw data dumps.
- 🚀 Start **simple**, but design for **extensibility**.
- 🧠 Treat **reasoning** itself as a **first-class citizen** of delivery health.

## 2. 🔁 Process Flow Overview

| **Stage** | **Action** |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Pod (GPT + Human Lead) works on task and generates reasoning thoughts |
| 2 | Thoughts are logged in `.logs/reasoning/{task_id}.md` |
| 3 | At finalization, Human Lead quickly rates reasoning (thought quality 1-5, recall, novelty) |
| 4 | GPT (optional) generates a summarized reasoning insight (`{task_id}_summary.md`) |
| 5 | Output files, patches, and scores are saved |
| 6 | `metrics_tracker.py` parses logs and `task.yaml` to generate project metrics |
| 7 | FastAPI `/metrics/summary` endpoint serves live project insights |
| 8 | Retrospectives, dashboards, and improvements are driven from real reasoning + delivery data |

---

## 3. 🗂️ Data Artifacts

| **File/Storage** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|-------------|
| `task.yaml` | Source of truth for task status, timestamps |
| `.logs/reasoning/{task_id}.md` | Raw thoughts and manual scoring fields |
| `.logs/reasoning/{task_id}_summary.md` | GPT-generated summary of reasoning |
| `.logs/patches/` | Patch success/failure logs |
| `.logs/errors/` | Any error tracking (optional future) |
| `memory.yaml` | Tracks inputs, outputs, memory links (optional for deeper recall tracking) |

---

## 4. 📊 Metrics and Reports

### 📈 Quantitative Delivery Metrics

| **Metric** | **Source** |
|------------|------------|
| Total Tasks | `task.yaml` |
| Completed Tasks | `task.yaml` |
| Completion Rate (%) | Computed |
| Average Cycle Time (days) | `task.yaml` timestamps |
| Patch Success Rate (%) | `logs/patches/` |

---

### 🧠 Qualitative Reasoning Metrics

| **Signal** | **Source** |
|------------|------------|
| Average Thought Quality Score | `.logs/reasoning/` (manual or GPT scoring) |
| Recall Usage (%) | Tags like `[recall_used]` |
| Novelty Rate (%) | Tags like `[novel_insight]` |
| Reasoning Summaries | GPT-generated summaries |

---

### 📝 Metrics Report Structure (Sample `/metrics/summary` Output)

```json
{
  "quantitative": { ... },
  "qualitative": { ... },
  "reasoning_summaries": {
    "2.1a_refine_project_goals": "Summary text...",
    "2.2b_define_user_stories": "Summary text...",
    ...
  }
}
```

✅ Human Leads can query **project health** and **reasoning patterns** live.

## 5. ⚙️ Technology Components

| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|-------------|
| `metrics_tracker.py` | Main script to load data and generate summaries |
| `retrospective_generator.py` (optional) | Deeper reflection based on reasoning |
| FastAPI `/metrics/summary` | Live API endpoint for delivery health |
| GPT Summarization Function | Summarizes reasoning logs per task |
| Future: Visualization UI | Dashboard view of project metrics |

## 6. 🛠️ Initial Implementation Backlog (Queue)

| **Priority** | **Task** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| 🥇 | `metrics_tracker.py` MVP | Load `task.yaml` + reasoning logs and compute MVP metrics |
| 🥇 | Reasoning Scoring Template | Update reasoning `.md` template to include scoring fields |
| 🥈 | GPT Summarizer Function | Generate `{task_id}_summary.md` from reasoning trace |
| 🥈 | `/metrics/summary` Endpoint | Create FastAPI route returning JSON summary |
| 🥈 | Update Finalization Checklist | Add step for Human Lead to rate thoughts at task finish |
| 🥉 | Optional: `retrospective_generator.py` | Generate project reflection from reasoning summaries |
| 🥉 | Optional: Visualization App | Streamlit dashboard to view metrics live |

---

## 🎯 MVP Definition (Phase 1 Done When…)

- ✅ Quantitative metrics computed (completion, cycle time, patch success)
- ✅ Qualitative metrics collected (thought quality, recall, novelty)
- ✅ Reasoning summaries generated
- ✅ FastAPI `/metrics/summary` working
- ✅ Sample report looks insightful and usable

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

✅ This gives full **delivery visibility** — not just **how much** was done, but **how well** the system **thought**.  
✅ It's **small, lightweight, and composable** — easy to expand later into:

- Advanced retrospectives
- Lessons learned libraries
- Potential RLHF fine-tuning for Pods if desired
