# üõ†Ô∏è AI-Native Delivery: Frictionless Patch Promotion System

## üìñ Process Overview

At the core of the AI-native delivery model is the ability for AI Pods (GPTs) to not only create outputs but also to promote outputs safely, traceably, and scalably without human bottlenecks.

Here‚Äôs how the frictionless patch promotion process works:

1. **Task Completion:**  
   A GPT Pod completes its assigned task (e.g., updating a spec, code, or config file).

2. **Patch Preparation:**  
   The Pod constructs the final output, typically a full file (not a diff).

3. **Promotion Request:**  
   The Pod uses a FastAPI action (e.g., `/update-file`) to request a file update on GitHub.

4. **FastAPI ‚Üí PyGithub Call:**  
   The FastAPI server receives the request and uses PyGithub to:
   - Fetch the current file from GitHub
   - Compare SHAs to ensure no conflicts
   - Update or create the file safely
   - Auto-commit the changes to the GitHub repo

5. **Commit and Traceability:**  
   GitHub generates a commit and diff automatically, preserving:
   - Full file history
   - Clean human-readable diffs
   - Reasoning traces and metadata attached by the Pod

6. **Optional Human Review:**  
   Humans can still review changes via GitHub Pull Requests, if desired.

## üß† One-Sentence Summary

**AI-native delivery is about letting intelligent agents drive work forward, while the human lead steers strategy ‚Äî and this frictionless patch system makes it safe, scalable, and efficient.**

---

## üöÄ Coming Up Next (Optional Enhancements)

- ‚úÖ Add automatic retry on merge conflict (safe fallback).
- ‚úÖ Add "create if not exists" fallback for missing files.
- ‚úÖ Add batch patch promotions (multiple files in one call).
- ‚úÖ Attach `reasoning_trace.md` automatically per commit.

## üì¶ Bonus: Auto-Retry `update_file_with_retry()` Helper

You can drop this into your FastAPI backend today:

```python
from github import GithubException

def update_file_with_retry(repo, file_path, new_content, branch="main", commit_message="Update file", max_retries=2):
    retries = 0
    while retries <= max_retries:
        try:
            # Fetch the latest version of the file
            file = repo.get_contents(file_path, ref=branch)

            # Update the file
            repo.update_file(
                path=file.path,
                message=commit_message,
                content=new_content,
                sha=file.sha,
                branch=branch
            )
            print(f"‚úÖ Successfully updated {file_path} on {branch}!")
            return

        except GithubException as e:
            if e.status == 409:  # Conflict
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict detected. Retrying fetch and update (attempt {retries+1})...")
                retries += 1
                continue
            elif e.status == 404:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è File not found. Creating new file: {file_path}")
                repo.create_file(
                    path=file_path,
                    message=commit_message,
                    content=new_content,
                    branch=branch
                )
                return
            else:
                raise e
    raise Exception(f"‚ùå Failed to update {file_path} after {max_retries} retries due to persistent conflicts.")
```

‚úÖ **Handles:**
- Merge conflicts (`409 Conflict`) ‚Üí retry
- Missing file (`404`) ‚Üí create new file
- Other errors ‚Üí raise cleanly

---

## üî• TL;DR

You are operationalizing a breakthrough ‚Äî moving from tool-based to agent-native delivery.  
It‚Äôs efficient, safe, traceable, and scales effortlessly as your Pods grow.

# üöÄ Batch Patch Promotion Overview

## üìñ Current State

Today you have:

‚û°Ô∏è One file at a time update via:

```python
repo.update_file(path, message, content, sha, branch)
```

## üß† Why Batch Promotion?

In a real AI-native delivery flow, Pods often complete **multiple files in a single task**, such as:

- Memory updates (`memory.yaml`, `task.yaml`)
- Output files (`outputs/` folder)
- Reasoning traces (`reasoning_trace.md`)
- Prompt updates (`prompts/` folder)

üëâ **Goal:**  
We want a single FastAPI action like `/batch-promote-patch`, where:

- The GPT submits multiple files
- The FastAPI server handles them one by one
- It commits each safely
- It handles conflicts and creates missing files if needed
- It returns a success/failure report per file

---

## üì¶ Batch Payload Design

The GPT would send a JSON payload like:

```json
{
  "branch": "main",
  "commit_message": "Promote multiple patch files from Pod output",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "outputs/memory_update.yaml",
      "content": "new memory yaml content here"
    },
    {
      "path": "outputs/task_update.yaml",
      "content": "new task yaml content here"
    },
    {
      "path": "reasoning_trace.md",
      "content": "# Reasoning Trace\n\n- Decision 1...\n- Decision 2..."
    }
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ **No need for SHA upfront** ‚Äî the backend will fetch the current SHA for each file individually.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Batch Promotion FastAPI Route Sketch

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from github import GithubException

router = APIRouter()

class FileUpdate(BaseModel):
    path: str
    content: str

class BatchPatchRequest(BaseModel):
    branch: str
    commit_message: str
    files: list[FileUpdate]

@router.post("/batch-promote-patch")
async def batch_promote_patch(request: BatchPatchRequest):
    g = Github(os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN"))
    repo = g.get_repo(os.getenv("GITHUB_REPO"))  # e.g., "stewmckendry/ai-delivery-framework"

    results = []

    for file_update in request.files:
        try:
            # Fetch current file
            file = repo.get_contents(file_update.path, ref=request.branch)

            # Update file
            repo.update_file(
                path=file_update.path,
                message=request.commit_message,
                content=file_update.content,
                sha=file.sha,
                branch=request.branch
            )
            results.append({"path": file_update.path, "status": "updated"})

        except GithubException as e:
            if e.status == 404:
                # Create if missing
                repo.create_file(
                    path=file_update.path,
                    message=request.commit_message,
                    content=file_update.content,
                    branch=request.branch
                )
                results.append({"path": file_update.path, "status": "created"})
            elif e.status == 409:
                results.append({"path": file_update.path, "status": "conflict"})
            else:
                results.append({"path": file_update.path, "status": f"error: {e.data}"})

    return {"results": results}
```

## üéØ What This Enables

| Feature                   | Why It Matters                                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One API call, many updates  | GPT can promote entire output bundles at once                             |
| Auto-create missing files  | First-time outputs (e.g., new `memory.yaml`) don‚Äôt fail                    |
| Conflict-aware             | Per-file reporting if conflicts happen                                    |
| Fast and safe              | Optimized for scale: handle 1 or 100 files                                |
| Clear status report        | GPT can read response and retry conflicts or alert human                 |

---

## üìã Example Success Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {"path": "outputs/memory_update.yaml", "status": "updated"},
    {"path": "outputs/task_update.yaml", "status": "updated"},
    {"path": "reasoning_trace.md", "status": "created"}
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ GPT sees that everything succeeded.

If conflicts happen, the GPT could:

- Retry just the conflicted files
- Escalate for human help

---

## üß† Small Future Optimization

Later, you could enhance the batch flow by:

- Batch committing multiple files into one GitHub commit (advanced)
- Grouping changes by logical patch for even better reasoning traceability

|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity | One clean OpenAPI tool for multi-file promotion                    |
| Speed      | Fewer GPT API calls needed                                          |
| Safety     | Still protects repo with SHA conflict detection                    |
| Human Oversight | Optional if needed, fully traceable if not                   |
| Scaling    | Supports bigger Pods, multi-file outputs                            |

## üîß Core Functions and Patterns

```python
from github import Github

# Authenticate
g = Github("your_github_token")

# Access user and repo
user = g.get_user()
repo = g.get_repo("username/repo-name")

# List files
contents = repo.get_contents("")
for file in contents:
    print(file.path)

# Fetch and update a file
file = repo.get_contents("path/to/file.md")
repo.update_file(
    path=file.path,
    message="Update file",
    content="New content",
    sha=file.sha,
    branch="main"
)

# Create a file
repo.create_file(
    path="folder/new_file.txt",

## üî• Important Concepts

### What Happens When You `update_file`?

| Step                 | Behavior                                                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fetch file first     | `get_contents()` retrieves file with `.sha`, `.path`, `.decoded_content` |
| Pass `sha` into `update_file` | GitHub checks SHA to avoid overwriting concurrent changes |
| GitHub creates commit | Diff and commit auto-generated                                 |
| No cloning needed     | Fully API-driven workflow                                       |

### PyGithub Error Handling

| Situation            | Exception Type              | Notes                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| File not found       | `GithubException` (404)       | Create file if needed            |
| Merge conflict       | `GithubException` (409)       | Refetch file, retry update       |
| Auth failure         | `BadCredentialsException`     | Wrong/expired token              |
| Rate limit exceeded  | `RateLimitExceededException`  | 5000/hour limit with auth        |

Use `try/except` to handle errors gracefully.

```python
from github import GithubException

try:
    repo.update_file(...)
except GithubException as e:
    print(f"‚ùå GitHub error: {e.status} - {e.data}")
```

---

## üîë About SHA

- SHA = Secure Hash Algorithm
- In Git, every file/version/commit is identified by a unique 40-character SHA-1 hash.
- PyGithub uses SHA to ensure version safety on updates.

| Concept           | Meaning                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SHA in Git        | Unique fingerprint for every file/version                 |
| SHA in PyGithub   | Required to update a file safely without conflicts         |
| Update safety     | GitHub checks SHA before applying your changes             |

üì¶ **SHA protects you from overwriting someone else's updates.**

# üöÄ Why PyGithub + FastAPI + Actions = Frictionless AI-Native Delivery

‚úÖ **Structured Automation**:  
GPTs don't touch Git ‚Äî they just call APIs to update files safely.

‚úÖ **Version Safety**:  
SHA checking prevents lost updates and enables retry logic.

‚úÖ **Frictionless Pipelines**:  
Pods complete work ‚ûî FastAPI serves ‚ûî PyGithub commits ‚ûî Humans review clean diffs.

‚úÖ **Scalable and Fast**:  
No repo clones, no manual commits ‚Äî everything is API-first and Pod-friendly.

‚úÖ **Error-Resilient**:  
Standard exceptions (409 conflict, 404 not found) are handled cleanly in FastAPI.
