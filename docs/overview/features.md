# âœ¨ Core Features of AI-Native Delivery

The Framework introduces multiple innovations across Users, Processes, Data/AI, and Technology.

---

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Modular Pod System

**Feature:** Specialized GPT Pods with targeted missions (ProductPod, ResearchPod, QAPod, etc.)

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Pods know their scope and behaviors. |
| Process | Tasks are assigned based on Pod specialties. |
| Data & AI | Pods reason with prior memory and deliver outputs + thoughts. |
| Tech Stack | Custom GPT actions route task flows and memory access. |

**Why It Matters:**  
Enables scalable parallel workstreams without human bottlenecks.

---

## ðŸ§  2. Structured Memory Layer

**Feature:** memory.yaml indexes all important project knowledge.

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Pods search memory for prior work before generating. |
| Process | Memory updated with every meaningful output. |
| Data & AI | Memory items are structured (file_path, description, tags). |
| Tech Stack | FastAPI endpoints manage memory, GitHub stores canonical files. |

**Why It Matters:**  
Preserves institutional knowledge without relying on human memory.

## ðŸ”Ž 3. Reasoning Traceability

**Feature:** Every Pod captures its thought process in `.logs/reasoning/`.

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Reasoning traces make Pods' thinking transparent. |
| Process | Reasoning informs patch reviews and metrics. |
| Data & AI | Reasoning quality scored for novelty, recall, structure. |
| Tech Stack | Reasoning saved to GitHub, parsed for metrics. |

**Why It Matters:**  
Auditable AI, improved outputs, ethical compliance baked in.

---

## ðŸ›  4. Automated Patch Promotion

**Feature:** Outputs, reasoning, and memory updates bundled into a ZIP, promoted automatically.

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Pods promote patches via FastAPI â†’ GitHub â€” no manual script running. |
| Process | Patch metadata is structured, reviewable, and trackable. |
| Data & AI | Patch summaries + memory diffs provide visibility. |
| Tech Stack | PyGitHub + FastAPI drive patch promotion. |

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces friction, increases flow speed, maintains quality traceability.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ 5. Metrics-Driven Improvement

**Feature:** Delivery and reasoning metrics computed live.

| View | Details |
|:---|:---|
| User | Human Leads track project health, thought quality. |
| Process | Retrospectives informed by real delivery signals. |
| Data & AI | Metrics include completion rate, thought novelty, recall rate. |
| Tech Stack | FastAPI `/metrics/summary` endpoint serves live insights. |

**Why It Matters:**  
Data-driven improvement, not anecdotal feedback loops.
