ðŸ“¦ TOOL: get_patch (GET /patches/{patch_name})

Use this tool to fetch the contents of a previously generated patch.

You must already know the `patch_file` name (e.g., returned by `promote_patch`).

Provide:
- `patch_name`: The exact file name to retrieve (e.g., "patch_20250422_103045_2.3_build_metrics_tool.diff")

This will return the raw diff text, which you can save to `chatgpt_repo/.patches/` for promotion.

Prompt:
Please fetch the raw diff content for the following patch file using the get_patch tool:
patch_name: patch_20250422_103045_2.3_build_metrics_tool.diff
