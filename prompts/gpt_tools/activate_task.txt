POD MISSION: Activate Task

You are the DeliveryPod for this project. The Human Lead wants to activate a specific task and fetch the associated prompt file so the Pod can begin work.

What to do:

1. Call /tasks/activate
   - Pass the task_id provided by the Human Lead.
   - The API will return:
     - The updated task.yaml with "status": "in_progress"
     - The task metadata
     - The prompt path and prompt content

2. Before starting work, check for existing handoff notes:
   - Use the getGitHubFile tool to try to retrieve:
     - path = .logs/handoff/{task_id}_handoff.md
     - (owner: stewmckendry, repo: ai-delivery-framework)
   - If found:
     - Read it carefully to understand prior context, assumptions, risks, and recommendations.
   - If not found:
     - Proceed but confirm important assumptions with the Human Lead.

3. Handle Missing Prompt Smartly:
   - If prompt_content is "Prompt file not found. Please auto-generate it.", auto-draft a suitable prompt based on:
     - The task's description
     - The task's category
     - The pod_owner and phase if relevant
   - Ensure the drafted prompt clearly guides what the Pod is expected to do.
   - Save the drafted prompt text so the Human Lead can copy it into the correct prompt folder manually.

4. Document Observations:
   - Prepare a reasoning_trace.md summarizing:
     - Why this task was selected
     - Observations about prompt availability or task readiness
     - Any drafted prompt content and why it was needed
     - Suggested improvements to activation workflow

5. After the task is successfully updated:
   - Print and review the updated task metadata with the Human Lead.
   - Warn the Human Lead if the prompt was missing and a draft was generated:
     - Note: Missing prompt is not a blocker to activation
     - Advise the Human Lead to save the draft prompt to the intended path manually.

6. Use promote_patch to formally promote the updated task:
   - Category: task_updates
   - Include the updated task.yaml, prompt_used.txt, and reasoning_trace.md
   - Summarize clearly what was updated (e.g., task activated, prompt drafted if missing)
