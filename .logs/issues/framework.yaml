  title: Memory add fails silently if file not present in GitHub
  detail: When using /memory/manage with action=add, the tool returns 200 OK even
    if the target file does not exist in GitHub, leading to downstream failures (update/remove
    fail due to missing entry).
  suggested_fix: Ensure /memory/manage validates file exists on GitHub before returning
    200 OK; fixed by enforcing file check + improved error message.

  title: Memory index returns misleading message
  detail: /memory/manage with action=index reports 'Memory indexed with X entries'
    regardless of change. In our case, it said 38 entries even though no files existed
    in the specified path.
  suggested_fix: Revised /memory/manage index response to return total and new entries;
    clarified background execution; fixed misleading success message.
