  title: Memory add fails silently if file not present in GitHub
  detail: When using /memory/manage with action=add, the tool returns 200 OK even
    if the target file does not exist in GitHub, leading to downstream failures (update/remove
    fail due to missing entry).
  suggested_fix: Ensure /memory/manage validates file exists on GitHub before returning
    200 OK; fixed by enforcing file check + improved error message.

  title: Memory index returns misleading message
  detail: /memory/manage with action=index reports 'Memory indexed with X entries'
    regardless of change. In our case, it said 38 entries even though no files existed
    in the specified path.
  suggested_fix: Revised /memory/manage index response to return total and new entries;
    clarified background execution; fixed misleading success message.

  title: Missing task_id when creating new task
  detail: When using /tasks/lifecycle with action=create, the returned payload did
    not include a task_id if none was explicitly passed. This prevented follow-on
    lifecycle actions. Issue fixed by generating an ID if not provided.
  suggested_fix: Auto-generate a task_id if none is passed during create. Patch now
    ensures task_id is returned.

  title: Reopen task fails if pod_owner not passed
  detail: 'Calling /tasks/lifecycle with action=reopen on a completed task failed
    with error ''detail: pod_owner''. This occurred even though pod_owner was set
    during task creation. Patch now uses default pod_owner if not explicitly passed.'
  suggested_fix: Apply default pod_owner on reopen if not explicitly passed. Fix deployed.

  title: Missing task_id in task creation
  detail: Calling /tasks/lifecycle with action=create did not return a task_id if
    one wasn't passed, blocking downstream calls. Fixed by patch that generates and
    returns task_id when not supplied.

  title: Reopen fails if pod_owner missing
  detail: Calling /tasks/lifecycle with action=reopen failed when pod_owner wasn't
    passed, despite being set in the task. Fixed by patch using assigned_pod as fallback.
  suggested_fix: Patch now defaults pod_owner from assigned_pod if not explicitly
    passed.
